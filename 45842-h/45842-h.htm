  <h1 class='c005'>THE ERRATIC FLAME</h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />THE SCORCHING LIMELIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As the mountain mist, caressing and desultory, resolved
into a steady downpour, Anne glimpsed just above
her the outlines of a hut. Crouched behind sodden boughs,
decrepit, ramshackle, it tottered upon the lip of the ravine.
With an amused sense of relief she trudged up towards it,
her feet sinking amongst a welter of brown leaves, her
whole being cleansed within the gray mantle of the rain.
After a hectic summer of bridge and dancing this solitude
of dripping trees and drenched leaves, fell upon her bruised
spirit like a benediction. Anne thanked her very modern and
somewhat pagan gods for having inspired her to escape from
the inglorious rut. To-day, the New York season ahead of
her, shone meretricious in the face of the crystal cleanliness
of bathing woods. Perhaps she would give it all up and
open the villa in Florence immediately instead of waiting
until after Christmas. The very thought rested her. She
attained the top of the ravine with renewed serenity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its gaunt outlines blurred by rain, the hut stood before
her. Assailed by a feeling of almost girlish excitement she
smiled with inward amusement. Surfeited, world-weary,
surely she was not foolish enough to expect a thrill lurking
within the walls of a dilapidated mountain cabin?</p>

<p class='c008'>The careless little smile on her lips, she stepped upon
the crazy porch and tried the door. Obstinate in mood it resisted
her onslaught with almost personal violence. But she
braced her back upon its gray stubbornness, and giving a
vigorous push, burst into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dim, inhospitable, alien, its opaque shadows menaced
vaguely. Still smiling, Anne ventured boldly forward.
Then, as her eyes fell upon the hearth, hesitated, for from
the embers rose a nebulous tube of smoke. Its faint, acrid
tang rode the stale air challengingly. Anne darted a keen
glance about her, focusing upon the extreme corner of
the room where a denser blackness prevailed, which as she
approached resolved itself into a couch and a mass of tossed
blankets from which emerged a head; a tumbled, lolling
head, which drooped towards the floor as if in pursuit of its
own heavy, trailing hand. Pathetic, remote behind closed
lids, it carried to Anne a summons both tragic and impelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew nearer and peered down into the pallid features.
It was the face of a dissipated young god, glistening with
a pallor of unhealth, beautiful in its decadence, with the
pagan beauty of a Praxiteles.</p>

<p class='c008'>A wave of pity and excitement surged over her. A boy,
ill and alone; a boy with the face of a fallen Lucifer!
She leaned over and placed her hand upon the pale forehead.
It was cold and moist beneath a tangle of tumbled curls.
She shivered slightly at the contact.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephemeral as was her touch, the leaden lids rose beneath
it, and she found herself gazing down into a pair of weary,
indifferent young eyes. She backed away hastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy intercepted her recoil with a harsh laugh. Sitting
up, he clasped his head, and gazed at her from under long
and pallid fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you think I was dead?” he said with a mocking
air. “And what would you have done if I had been?”
He shot her a look of impish hostility.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne assumed an air of indifference.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There would have been a lot of red tape, I suppose,” she
said curtly over her shoulder. She turned and walked slowly
toward the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arms clasped about his knees, he looked after her with
dawning interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you going?” he said brusquely. “You can’t
leave now in this rain.” He looked up at the roof against
which rushing waters beat a thunderous tattoo. Scrambling
to his feet, he started towards her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She met the haggard young eyes with composure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I came in here, I thought the place was deserted,”
she said simply, “and then, when I saw you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You thought I was dead!” he interposed with a repetition
of the short, dry laugh. “No such luck!” He checked
himself. “Seriously, you won’t be so foolish as to go out
again until the rain stops, will you? Just because you find
me offensive? I’ll make up the fire, and you must dry yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he said this, a sudden child-like smile lighted up the
somber face. Anne decided it would be ridiculous not to
stay. After all, the young brute could not eat her. It was
only a few weeks since she had recovered from summer flu
and she shrank from inviting another attack of the insidious
enemy. Besides, in spite or perhaps because of his haggard
young impudence, there welled up from her subconscious a
primitive desire to see the adventure to the finish. And as
she watched the slight figure busying itself at the hearth, she
was smitten with a vague sense of familiarity. Where had
she seen that pale face, those uptilted, faunlike eyebrows?
That classic throat, which rose columnar from the négligée
shirt? And above all, those hands, those square, elongated
fingers? In some ancient bronze or marble?</p>

<p class='c008'>She took the chair nearest the hearth and stretching her
hands to the blaze, watched his impassive features as the firelight
played upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” he said non-committally, “better take off
your sweater, it’s dripping. I’ll lend you one in the meanwhile.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a quick gesture, he lighted the lamp upon the table,
and opening a drawer in the ramshackle bureau, drew out a
heavy wool sweater, and with a casual gesture, threw it about
her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a beauty!” She met his indifference with an
amused smile as she caressed the smooth texture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The eyes beneath the heavy lids mocked her. She realized
with amused dismay that he evidently thought she was trying
to flirt with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to make tea,” he said abruptly. “All women
like tea.” His voice was contemptuous.</p>

<p class='c008'>The callow brutality roused her sense of humor. She
removed her hat and ran her hands through hair which glistened
like burnished chestnuts in the firelight. She smiled as
she caught his eyes resting upon it unwillingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What have women done to you?” she inquired softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He gave her a quick, menacing look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are tyrants, all of you,” he sneered savagely.
“Greedy for everything. For money, flattery, love, especially
love. Insatiable! Demanding, always demanding but—I
promised you tea, I believe.” He finished somewhat lamely,
and striding to the cupboard produced a tin, a loaf of bread
and some butter.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him from beneath inscrutable lashes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry you’re unhappy,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are all unhappy,” he evaded. He poured water into
the dingy kettle hanging over the fire. “You are unhappy
because you are wet, and like a civilized lady want your tea.
I am unhappy because my head aches most damnably! For
me there is no help but time, but for you there is orange
pekoe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For a soulless creature like a woman there is always food,
eh?” she teased. “But a masculine intellect demands only
spiritual sustenance?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed more naturally, as he met her mocking glance.
“I must seem an awful fool to you,” he said somewhat
sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head, still smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, I was merely thinking what a mixture of sullen
boy and embittered cynic you are. Do you know you are a
very odd person, indeed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at once flattered and woebegone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose it’s this damned forcing-house I’ve lived in.”
He muttered as he sliced the bread rather clumsily, with his
most unclumsy-looking hands. “Limelight doesn’t mellow, it
scorches!” Then as he met her astonished gaze, he checked
himself abruptly. “Bread and butter and cigarettes are all
I can offer, unless the storm has whetted you sufficiently for
bacon and eggs?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed a denial, and springing up, lifted the chuckling
kettle off the hearth. The boy hurried to her assistance and
their flesh met over the handle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you’re a celebrity?” she thrust at him, as he took the
kettle from her and placed it on a table. Beneath her scrutiny
his features again became a mask, except for the eyes, which
gleamed liquid in the firelight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You flatter me,” he laughed with forced lightness.
“Must I decrease my importance and the romance of the
occasion by revealing my humble identity?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No indeed!” exclaimed Anne, “that would spoil everything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the odd little speech about the limelight had
challenged her curiosity, and as she continued to observe him, that
strange sense of familiarity which the first impression of his
face had given, insinuated itself into her consciousness more
securely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” she murmured without an appreciable pause. “Let’s
just be two stray cats crawling into shelter from the rain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An expression of relief thawed his frozen young face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the Persian must not be shocked if the alley-cat does
not know how to behave and laps up his milk rudely.” He
laughed as he poured out her tea, and handed her the bread
and butter. For the moment he looked almost happy, altogether
boyish. He seated himself on the other side of the
table, and gazed into the fire, which crackled up into their
faces with the officiousness of an elderly chaperon. Its self-conscious
sputter neutralized the clamor of the rain and
somehow pleased him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How elemental,” he threw out his hands in an expressive
gesture. “A storm, a fire, and a cave,” he looked about the
shadowy room whimsically. “A man and a woman—food—.
We might be in the Stone Age.” His cynical gaze probed
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s laugh was a rippling murmur.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A moment ago we were cats. Our evolution has been
rapid!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She pushed aside her chair, rose, and walking quickly to
the window, peered through the crooked panes, at the dusky
woods beyond.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The rain is letting up,” she announced briefly. “I must
go home, or Regina will worry herself into a fever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His somber laugh rang harshly. “So you prefer cats to
cavemen?” He joined her in a couple of lazy strides. “That
isn’t at all up to date! May I inquire who is Regina, and still
preserve our charming incognito?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is my Italian maid. We are alone here this fall
and she will be wild if I don’t hurry. She has been with
me since I was a child and I’m scarcely allowed to breathe
without her permission,” she replied rather more expansively
than she had intended.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if you must!” he shrugged. “I suppose I ought to
say something romantic about ‘ships that pass in the night,’
etc. But as I am a misogynist”—he hesitated, looking at her
with a sarcastic smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>She took him up gaily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You merely hand me my hat, and tell me I look old
enough to take care of myself!” She drew the flabby object
down over her head, and met his smouldering gaze with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re really not so glad to have me go as you pretend,”
she challenged. Then she caught her breath, for he had
thrown out his arms with a savage look, and for a moment she
thought he was going to crush her within them. But, letting
them drop abruptly, he turned, and pulling his mackintosh
off the wall, thrust it about her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go, since you wish it,” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later they were stumbling down the mountainside.
Almost obliterated by rain the path had become precipitous.
Masses of dead leaves choked their progress. At
every step they slid and waded, ankle-deep in scaly moisture,
until Anne wanted to scream at the reptilian contact.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s something corpse-like about them,” she said, as
she stumbled along behind the blinding rays of the lantern.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not? That’s exactly what they are,” he replied
grimly. He held aside a sodden branch for her to pass under.
“Corpses, heaped victims of the storm, as dead as you and
I shall be some day, as dead as I wish I were myself this
moment!” He laughed harshly. Then as her hand touched
his arm, added more gently, “Surely, you are not afraid of
death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, of course not.” She huddled more closely to his
side, “Only you’re so young it seems a shame——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He interrupted her savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All the better! Life is sufficiently drab without having
to pass through the horrors of decrepitude and senility.
Death is the only apology the gods can offer, for having
thrust us into it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he spoke they emerged from the dripping woods on to
the road, and the walking became easier.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you want to get somewhere, to do something worthwhile
before you die?” she asked looking pityingly into the
young face so white and set in the lantern rays.</p>

<p class='c008'>His lips curled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get somewhere! Do something! That is meaningless
jargon. There is really no goal, no destination. We merely
fool ourselves into thinking there is. Work is only a drug,
a means of forgetting. A good drug, I admit, and at times
even heady, but a drug, nevertheless!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her hold upon his arm tightened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, how unhappy you must be! How sorry I am for
you!” she cried with unmistakable sincerity. “Do tell me
what is the matter. I am sure I could help you. You’re so
young, you probably exaggerate.” She caught herself up for
fear of wounding him. “I mean I’m older than you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held her hand out pleadingly towards him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He clasped it in his long fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” he replied more quietly, “I believe you mean
it, but I cannot, indeed I cannot!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not urge, and they walked on in silence. The
rain had stopped so gradually, that neither of them remembered
when it had ceased to fall. Presently, they turned a
bend in the road and came upon lights close at hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s my cottage,” said Anne, in a slightly surprised
tone. “I didn’t know we were so near. Come in and
Regina will get us some supper. Then you can rest awhile
before returning home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One foot on the step, he looked up at her, as she stood
on the porch above him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, the play is over, the lights are out. I must return to
my hut and—” beneath his breath—“my devils.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Although he had already turned about, Anne heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your devils can get along perfectly well without you.
Besides I have one myself. Let us share them together.
Come, I see we need each other badly tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Compassionate beneath her light manner, she caught him
by the back of the coat with both hands, and pulled him
forcibly about. “Besides, I have your mackintosh and your
sweater. You mustn’t be so reckless with your property.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He followed her up the steps with obvious reluctance. She
opened the door and drew him in through the glowing aperture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“See, there’s a fire,” she cried gaily. “And after supper
I’ll play to you.” She pointed to an upright in the corner.
“I can play even on an old country piano,” she boasted.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she saw his face. It was paler than the hands
which sought to conceal it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no music! Never again!” he muttered. He fell
weakly into the nearest chair, and with a low moan laid his
head on the arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sudden intuition flooded Anne’s being. How blind she
had been! How was it possible that she had not recognized
him sooner? A figure so well known, seen and listened to
by her so many times?</p>

<p class='c008'>She approached and laid her hand on the bowed head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know you now, Mr. Petrovskey. It was very stupid of
me not to have guessed before, only the light in the hut was
so very poor. But please don’t be worried,” she added gently,
as his drawn young face looked up into hers. “I can keep
a secret very well indeed, and my one desire is to help you.
You are not fit to go back to that lonely cabin to-night.
You must stay here, and we will see how you are in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He cast a wild glance about the rustic little room, as if he
feared someone might spring out upon him from behind the
pretty chintz curtains.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You cannot know how terrible this is,” he said. “It is
only a few weeks now—since it happened.” He choked
over the words. “And I feel as if I should like to hide forever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there is nothing to be ashamed of—” she commenced.
“Ashamed,” he cried, savagely. “I’m not ashamed! Only
I’m full of hatred, of disgust for everyone and everything.
I wish I could die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The tortured voice sent a lump into Anne’s throat. She
knelt beside the chair and laid a compassionate arm about
the shaking shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come,” said she. “You are ill and over-wrought. We
will go upstairs and Regina and I will help you to bed.
There’s a good boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The protective gesture, the kind words were too much.
Utterly beside himself, he turned and laid his head upon the
refuge of her breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are good, good,” he whispered. “You are not disappointed
in me because I’m a failure. You are not greedy
like the others, who only want what they can get out of me.
Yes, I will trust you and I will stay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he raised his head, she felt her neck was moistened with
his tears.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c009'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />ESCAPADE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After a sleepless night, Anne dozed late. So when
Regina brought in her coffee about nine o’clock as
usual, she awakened gropingly to fog. Fog, which filtered
in at the windows in layers of pale moonlight, and wreathed
about the house an ectoplasmic shroud until for a long moment
Anne had the illusion of floating through clouds in a dreamship.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Regina spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Dio mio</i>, it’s as chill as the finger of death in here!”
She closed the windows violently. “When will you learn to
take care of yourself, <i>carina</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne smiled. She was accustomed to these wild admonitions.
She sat up in bed and slipped into the green silk
kimono which Regina was holding out to her. The contrast
between her own slim white arms and the woman’s knotted
brown hands pleased her impersonally. She allowed her
fingers to rest upon Regina’s sleeve. Relaxed and peaceful,
the enshrouding fog rose like a protecting wall between her
and an irksome world. She sighed luxuriantly at the thought
of having left it all behind her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the memory of last night swooped down upon her
with the clamorous beat of wings and sleep departed. She
clasped Regina’s wrist with tense fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Regina, how is he? Where is he this morning?” she
exclaimed wide awake and anxious. “I had forgotten all
about him, poor boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman smiled benevolently. She placed the tray upon
a table beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He sleeps, <i>cara</i>, he sleeps. I but this moment popped
my head in at the door and he was lying there as still and
quiet as a child, <i>poverino</i>. So don’t worry your little head
about him, but eat your breakfast before it freezes to a
jelly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Anne did not hesitate. With a lithe movement she
was out of bed. Twisting the brazen rope of hair about her
small head, she fastened it with a massive gold hairpin.
Then, a mediæval princess, in trailing green draperies, she
swept from the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Left alone, Regina thrust hands and eyes to heaven and
called out upon her picturesque God. Then she shrugged
with Italian fatalism and despair. What else could she have
expected? It had been so from the very first. Anne had
always had her own way, ever since she herself had gone
to her as nurse when as a little girl they had lived in the
<i>palazzo</i> in Florence and her father had been the American
consul. Married and a widow, she still remained the same
wilful child in the eyes of the faithful, long-suffering, old
woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a shake of the white head, she followed her mistress
out into the narrow hallway and watched disapprovingly, as
she disappeared into the opposite room.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was cold in there and Anne shivered a little as she
entered. The fog shimmered in from the open window,
writhing itself between her and the recumbent figure on the
bed. Like Regina, she closed the window, although less
violently, smiling the while to herself at the similarity of
their action. Approaching the bed, she looked down upon
the sleeper. He was flushed and breathing irregularly, and
Anne was glad she had not trusted to Regina’s optimistic inspection.
For his hand and forehead were burning and her
touch did not arouse him. Rather alarmed, she took him
by the shoulders and shook him gently. He muttered, and
opening his eyes, gazed up at her, at first vacantly, then with
dawning dread.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although her heart beat a little faster, she smiled serenely
down upon him. “Well?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned his head away quickly, and for a moment the
unnatural flush was replaced by the glistening pallor of the
day before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must get up. I must go back,” he said self-consciously.
“I have trespassed upon you most shamefully. What can you
think of me?” Still avoiding her eye, he sat up in bed and
ran an unsteady hand through his tumbled hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>The serene smile upon her lips, she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you really want to know what I think? I think you
are going to stay right here, young man, for unless I am
much mistaken, you have fever, and if that is the case, I
shall not permit you to get up at all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He tossed his blonde mane impatiently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fever? Nonsense! I’m perfectly all right. There’s
nothing the matter with me at all, and I am going to get
up!” Flushed and unsteady, he stared at her defiantly, prepared
to throw off the clothes and jump out of bed. Then
remembered with horror that he was attired in one of
Regina’s ample and unpoetic nightrobes, and inhibited the
impulse with a groan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Repressing her amusement, Anne approached and took his
wrist in cool, silken fingers. “I’m going to take your temperature,
and if you have any fever, I shall send for a doctor
at once,” she announced composedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Horror stalked across the young face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, you mustn’t do that!” he exclaimed. “Nobody
must see me, nobody must know where I am! I’ll do
anything you want, if only you won’t send for a doctor, or let
anyone know I am here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His feverish clasp about her hands, Anne encountered his
imploring look with gravity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, I have your promise. I don’t know just how
much it is worth, of course, it is up to you to show me.
Now lie down again, and be a good patient while I get the
thermometer and change my dress.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Head obediently on the pillow, his eyes rested upon her
wistfully as she moved toward the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Must you change, you look so beautiful like that,” he said
simply. “Your lines are so flowing, so fluid, like music. A
Débussy prelude.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her hand on the knob, she laughed a little tremulously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your temperature must be even higher than I feared,” she
said lightly; looking at him rather shyly over her shoulder,
she left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next two days she and Regina were in constant attendance.
His fever had risen rapidly at first and Anne had
feared that after all she might have to break her word and
call in a doctor. She could even have done so without his
knowledge, for most of the time he had lain in a heavy
slumber, from which she and Regina had difficulty in arousing
him for his medicine. But she resisted the temptation.
And when the fever finally commenced to drop, experienced
a triumph disproportionately disturbing, which she explained
to herself as relief from the intolerable responsibility of her
position.</p>

<p class='c008'>The afternoon of the second day, as she sat beside the
window the sense of relief filtering through her, Regina
came into the room, and with a great show of excitement
and mystery, handed her the New York paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>She pointed to a picture on the second page, with excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Ecco lo</i>, there he is!” she exclaimed in a whisper. “And
I guessed it the moment I set eyes on him. For haven’t I
sat a dozen times in the gallery and listened to him while he
played, poor angel!” She approached and looked down at
the boy with a mixture of compassion and adoration. “<i>Poverino</i>,
how he has suffered,” she added, as she smoothed the bedclothes
beneath the unshaven young chin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne took the paper and looked at the photograph. It was
indeed he, violin under one arm, who looked at her with
cryptic eyes, eyes laden with all the tragedy of genius.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sighed. A little shiver passed through her, as she
glanced toward the bed. Why was genius inevitably companioned
by suffering? Why did those who possess it harbor
such strange magnetism, even when their personalities were
often repellent and ugly? And as she looked upon the
sleeping boy, an emotion to which she was not accustomed
stole upon Anne and kindled a flame, which scorched as well
as warmed. An embryonic temperament, drugged with artificial
activities, somnolent from ennui, stirred within her.
With a flutter of self-ridicule she focussed her attention upon
the newspaper in her hand, and read through the headlines
mechanically.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='sc'>Famous Young Musician Still Missing</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>In Spite of Frantic Search by</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>Anxious Relatives</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Alexis Petrovskey, who escaped ten days ago from the sanitarium
where he had gone to recuperate from nervous shock following upon
his unfortunate breakdown in Carnegie Hall last April, is still
missing, and a lake near the sanitarium is being dragged for his
body, as it is feared that in his state of acute melancholia he may
have made away with himself. Etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c012'>There followed encomiums upon his art and the great
loss his death would be to the musical world in general.</p>

<p class='c008'>So he had relatives, mused Anne, and for some cryptic
reason was unpleasantly stirred by the fact. That ought to
have occurred to her in the beginning and they were—how
had the newspaper put it?—frantic? Yes, that was it. They
would be, of course. And she was aiding and abetting this
unnatural young man to make them so. Put in that way, the
fact sounded very disagreeable, and yet—? She finished the
article with an impatient sigh, and turning her head, saw
that the mysterious object of her speculation was awake and
looking at her. There was an odd little smile upon his lips
and his eyes were very lucid. Conscious of a flaming and
obnoxiously juvenile blush, she folded the paper quickly and
threw it aside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too late!” he exclaimed in a rather weak voice. “I
have caught a glimpse of my beauteous self and know the
worst. So they haven’t been able to keep it out of the papers,
after all? Please show it to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He held out a long thin hand and she gave him the paper
without further parley. He sat up in bed and read the article
from start to finish.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Damn it!” he exclaimed, but rather placidly she thought.
Somehow he had the air of a naughty and triumphant small
boy. “This is an awful bore. What can I do to stop this
parrots’ talk?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let them know of your whereabouts, I suppose,” she replied
laconically. She walked to the window and looked out
through the vista of trees. “It is quite natural they should
be worried,” she added non-committally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you think I’m a brute.” His eyes lingered upon
the pearly nape of neck, where the copper tendrils coiled so
densely. “But if you knew all the circumstances, I believe
you would understand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The effort at self-command, the something piteous in his
voice thawed her superficial coldness. A gentle rush of
emotion coursed through her. She turned toward him impulsively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I don’t think you’re a brute! What right
would I have to do that, when I am ignorant of the facts?
Only I do think you ought to let them know——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat up in bed interrupting her savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t go back—I won’t go back!” he cried in a desperate
voice. “You don’t know what you are asking of me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A pang of curiosity shot through Anne against her will.
Why and of what was he so full of hatred and fear? But
her manner was calm and impersonal as she approached him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps you might let them know that you are safe and
with friends, and let it go at that?” she suggested soothingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shot her a strange look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Much she cares about my safety!” he muttered under his
breath. Anne heard with an unacknowledged but irritating
pang. So there was a wife, after all, in spite of his almost
adolescent appearance!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall I send your wife a telegram?” she inquired in a
matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My wife!” he stared at her in surprise. “My mother,
you mean!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Relief welled up in Anne’s heart, but she chose to ignore
its humiliating presence. “Your mother, then?” she pursued
evenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes I suppose we had better,” he acknowledged grudgingly.
“But she is absolutely not to know where I am, or to
try to communicate with me until I myself make the first
move. That is to be understood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” said Anne with composure. “I’m sure we
can manage that. It might be a good idea to write a letter
and have my chauffeur take it down to New York and mail
it from there? Or perhaps it would be even better if he
took it to your house and left it there. Then there would be
no postmark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re wonderful,” he cried enthusiastically. “I never
would have thought of that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She met his look of admiration demurely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, it is really a very simple idea. I’ll go and get
some notepaper and you had better write it yourself, so that
your mother can be sure that the letter is absolutely genuine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Acting as curb to his impetuosity and anger, she helped
him to concoct one of the strangest letters that a mother ever
received. Such a glacial letter, in spite of her own compassionate
tempering, that at the end Anne was loath to send
it at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will break her heart,” she said sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he laughed at her with bitter emphasis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Heart? She doesn’t possess one! All she cares about is
what she can get out of me, not only in money, but in vicarious
fame, as the fond mother of a musical prodigy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Shocked and pitiful, Anne regarded him. His flushed
cheeks and gleaming eyes warned of the ever-present danger
of recurring fever. She spoke kindly as if to a sick child.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure you’re exciting yourself unnecessarily. This will
never do. You’re not at all well, and things appear exaggeratedly
awful. I’m sure your mother loves you, how could she
help it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Loves me? That is good! Why, she has bled me since
I was seven years old. She has sometimes kept me at my
violin until I have fainted from exhaustion. She has purposely
isolated me from all friends and interests so that I
might have no outside influences to distract me. Because of
her, my life has been as narrow and as bleak as that of a
Trappist Monk. We have never had any home, any ties.
We have traveled from city to city, like a couple of strolling
players, and lived almost as poorly, although ever since my
twelfth year I have brought in thousands. But she wanted
to hoard. It is her passion. She’s very greedy. In fact,
she’s insatiable. She has always insisted upon being my
business manager, and it wasn’t until a couple of years ago
when I was twenty-one that I was allowed the use of some
of my own money. And then it was only because the doctors
frightened her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne met the triumph in his eyes with an inward shiver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Were you so ill?” she inquired, curiosity struggling with
repugnance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but I was so damned neurotic and unsociable and had
acquired so many complexes that they were afraid I would
develop dementia praecox if my chains weren’t slackened up
a bit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor boy, what happened then?” Anne seated herself
on the foot of his bed and prepared to listen to the end.
Very possibly, mental catharsis might succeed where the rest-cure
had failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>He continued vehemently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened? I took a three months’ vacation from
my music, which I had begun to detest in a furtive, unacknowledged,
sort of way, and for a time ran completely
wild. I was like an animal let out of a cage. I ran around
with a pack of fools who took me into every sort of imaginable
den and got me into every kind of imaginable scrape.
In fact, it was only the force of money and my mother’s
constant watchfulness which kept me out of the newspapers at
least a dozen times.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but didn’t she try to interfere? To reason with
you?” Anne was remotely angry at herself for being
offended by this recital.</p>

<p class='c008'>His laugh was sinister. The expression on his young face
mephistophelian.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Interfere? Why no, of course not. This fling was part
of her own plans, and according to the psycho-analyst for
whom she was going in heavily at the time, I would come
out a better money-making proposition. In other words, she
expected to reap from my wild oats a bounteous harvest for
the future!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Amused at Anne’s horrified expression, he chuckled sardonically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Motherly of her, don’t you think? But unfortunately,
for her tender intentions, the experiment was an awful fluke.
I came out of it as suddenly as I went in, only more melancholy,
more morose than before, utterly disgusted and
sickened with the whole scheme of creation. I wouldn’t
touch my violin for days, and for similar periods they
couldn’t get me away from it long enough to eat or sleep.
I gave a few recitals, brilliant but uneven, and the critics
were less kind than usual. My mother was in a perfect funk,
but I was utterly indifferent. Nothing interested me at all.
It was too much trouble even to live, and if I had condescended
to anything so positive as a wish, it would have been
for death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He paused, and threw himself back wearily upon the pillow.
“In fact, that is the way I am now, only the longing is
intense instead of indifferent.” He closed his eyes. An
expression of fatigue and disdain brooded over his drawn
features.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne leaned forward impulsively and took his long, hot
hand in both of hers. “Don’t,” she begged, “I cannot bear
to hear you speak so. It wrings something in my soul. Surely,
you will not remain so unhappy always. Your music, your
beautiful music will console you. It cannot fail!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His fingers twined about hers almost painfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My music, my beautiful music,” he murmured. He
turned his head on the pillow restlessly. “I shall not make
it any more. I’m not fit, I have dishonored it, and it will
not come to me any more. That night—” he faltered and
turned his head away from her pitying eyes. “When I
failed, you know?” His voice demanded her help.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, I know,” she whispered. “I was not there,
but I read about it in the paper. I felt so sorry, so heartbroken
for you. I had heard you so often, and with such
joy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tears in his eyes, he looked up at her gratefully and continued,
“That night I was playing as usual, in fact a little
better than usual, when all of a sudden every note went out
of my head completely, and left nothing but a blank. It was
as if music had ceased to exist. I wasn’t frightened or ill,
I simply couldn’t play the violin any more. That was all.
Since then I haven’t touched it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Drawing his hand abruptly out of hers, he turned on his
side and hid his face in the pillow. She rose, and standing
by the head of the bed, put her fingers on his tumbled,
blonde head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor boy, how horribly you have suffered! But I know
you are going to come out of it better and stronger than
ever. You are so young! The saying ought to be, ‘Where
there is youth there is hope.’” She sighed inaudibly, remembering
her thirty-three years with a pang. “Besides, you are
really lucky to have gone through your hell so early, while
you can still reap the benefits from it. For most of us it comes
too late and we retire defeated into middle age and spiritual
death. But,” she patted his head lightly, “I don’t want to
preach. It isn’t my <i>métier</i> at all! I’m supposed to be frivolous!
However, tell me, I simply must know before I
leave you, why did you run away from the sanitarium like
that without letting anyone know, and how did you ever find
the hut?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Beneath his laughter there lay an undercurrent of almost
fierce despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I should have gone completely mad if I had
stayed another minute. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I
was scarcely capable of thought, and yet they tried to cheer
me up as if I were an automaton, and all they had to do was
to turn a crank. I was supposed to sit on the lawn and
drink iced postum and be sociable with my fellow pariahs.
Then the radio was turned on every night and those who
could still hobble were expected to dance. So wholesome,
you know. Half crazed already, the canned music and
canned joviality finished me. The jazz sounded in my ears
all night. I felt as if my soul were being pounded into a
jelly. I couldn’t sleep a wink. So I packed my things and
stole away without saying a word. I think I had some delirious
idea of losing myself and my identity forever. I
hiked for the first few days, keeping to the woods for fear
of being found. I got my meals at stray farmhouses and
slept once or twice in a barn. When I came to the hut I
was pretty well exhausted and decided to rest up for a day
or two. That’s all,” he sighed wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s eyes were full of compassionate horror.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor boy, it must have been ghastly. I scarcely wonder
you wanted to end it all. And it was I who awakened you
from your first good sleep. Will you ever forgive me for
bringing you back to this sordid old world?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked up at her with worshipping eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not sordid with you in it,” he caught at her hand and
retained it. “You are the fairy princess, you know, who
broke the evil spell. To-day I feel—almost healed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The mournful young voice went to her heart. With an
assumption of gayety she ran to the window and pulled down
the shade.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very pretty indeed from a sick child. But now I am
really going. You must sleep. Later on I will bring you a
little supper, your first real meal under my roof, and we
will discuss the future. Meanwhile I will give your letter
to my chauffeur, who is going into New York anyway, to
bring back some necessary things for the house. And now,
sweet dreams.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned to leave the room, but before she could stop
him he drew her hand to his lips and kissed the palm passionately
and with reverence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next day he was so much better that he was allowed
to sit up in bed and dictate to Regina as to the proper disposal
of the contents of his suitcase which Anne’s chauffeur had
packed and brought down from the hut before leaving for
New York. Attired in a pair of his own pajamas, hair
brushed, face and hands washed by the delighted and flustered
old woman, Alexis was seriously contemplating a shave, when
at the bottom of the suitcase beneath some silk socks he came
upon Claire’s picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>He drew it out slowly, an expression of shrinking upon
his face. Where had it come from? He certainly would
never consciously have packed it among his things. And
neither would his mother have done so. The girl herself,
pitiful, sentimental little fool must have secreted it among
his things hoping that he would come upon it, and perhaps
cast her a random thought, as one throws a bone to a dog.
For Claire was like a dog, with the same beseeching, tragic
gaze that looked up at him now from the photograph so
reproachfully. A tremor of rage swept over him as he met
those wistful eyes. Damn it, what right had she to reproach
him and to look so woebegone! As if he, Alexis, were to
blame for everything. Hadn’t she fallen in with his mother’s
plans with alacrity, with indecency even? Yes, they had
tricked him nicely between them. Claire’s visit to his room
in the dead of night and his mother’s neatly-timed discovery,
and accusations. What else had there been to do after that,
but to marry the girl though they were both innocent even in
thought? No, Claire had no right to reproach him, for she
had deceived him, too. His mother, for her own cryptic
purposes and Claire in self-deluded passion. He had done
the only thing possible under the circumstances. Was it his
fault that he had never been able to love her? He had told
her so from the beginning, hadn’t he? She had nothing to
complain of. If he had neglected her, he at least had been
faithful in a technical sense. What mattered it if the faithfulness
had proceeded from indifference, rather than from a
sense of strict virtue? The fact remained, he had been
faithful. And to what? A tool of his insatiable mother; a
toy thrown to serve as outlet for hitherto-repressed physical
desires; a stuffed doll to appease nascent passion.</p>

<p class='c008'>He threw the picture from him with a savage gesture and
laughed aloud, much to Regina’s alarm. She hastened to
his side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The <i>signorino</i> is feeling gay?” she said hopefully, but
with a tinge of suspicion. The young man’s expression was
anything but gay! “Shall I call my <i>signora</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at the woman oddly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please do,” he mocked. “I want her to laugh with me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His wild look frightened the woman, she ran out of the
room, and presently Anne came in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you want me?” she asked quietly, with a quick glance
at his excited face.</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to show you something. Do you see this picture?”
He held out the photograph. Anne approached the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it your sister?” she noted the trembling fingers with
apprehension. A sudden knife-like foreboding pierced her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My sister!” he laughed. “No, unfortunately, no. This,”
he pointed a trembling, contemptuous finger at the small
tragic face, “this is a photograph of my wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s smile was a triumph of indifference.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed?” she said coolly. “She looks like quite a child,
doesn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat down calmly upon the chair beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Angered by her serenity, he flung her a look of mingled
hatred and remorse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you are wondering why I didn’t tell you about
her yesterday?” he grumbled.</p>

<p class='c008'>She lifted her brows in astonishment, her green eyes met
his coolly beneath unfathomable lashes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all, it is your own affair, isn’t it?” her voice was icy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, you are angry!” he exclaimed with satisfaction. “I
can see you are. I don’t suppose you’d believe me if I told
you that I completely forgot all about her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hardly!” Anne’s lips tightened unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, believe it or not, that is the truth! My so-called
wife counts for so little in my life, I seldom even think of
her, and when you asked to whom we should write yesterday,
she never entered my head. That is the only explanation I
have to offer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne returned his pleading glance with perfect composure.
She took the photograph out of his hand and gazed at it. As
she met the girl’s eyes, a tremor of sympathy quivered through
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She seems a pitiful little creature,” she murmured almost
against her will. “Why are you so hard on her?” She
avoided his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I don’t love her, I suppose!” he exclaimed harshly.
“And when one doesn’t love a woman, one hates her. It is
her own fault. She thrust herself into my life of her own
accord when my will was crushed and almost dead, and I
never shall forgive her for it. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more Anne interposed in the other woman’s behalf.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How pitiless you are! I don’t believe you understand her
at all. Perhaps she loves you? Indeed I am sure she must
love you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Loves me,” he jeered, “she thinks she does, she is a born
satellite. Her docility fills me with hatred, lowers me. When
I am with her I feel that I am having intercourse with a
slave, a chattel.” He flung his hands out before him, in
excess of emotion, then added more quietly, “but that is all
over now. For weeks I have barely spoken to her, and it is
my intention never to see her again if possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne shook her head gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Unfortunately, one cannot end things like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her angrily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not? If she is such a fool as to refuse to divorce
me, at least I can refuse to see her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you spoken to her of divorce?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course. But she will not listen. You see she is a
Roman Catholic and something of a mystic to boot. But why
do we bother about her so much?” He shrugged cynically.
“She is negligible. I have often forgotten her existence for
weeks at a time. That is why I don’t understand why the
very thought of her can upset me so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was something uncanny in the comprehending look
which Anne cast at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is because you cannot forgive her the injury you
have done her. It is her pain and not her love which bores
you. It is the memory of your own suffering and debased
self which you hate in her. She is so associated with your
weakness that the very mention of her name fills you with
hatred and humiliation. It is not her fault at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The calm voice ceased. Alexis faced the compassionate
eyes with horror in his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you are wrong, you are wrong. You do not understand.”
Then, as she continued to look at him as from a
great distance, “Don’t make me loathe myself more than I
do already!” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='c008'>With an odd little smile she turned to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps I am mistaken,” she said softly, her hand on the
knob. “But somehow I don’t believe I am. Think it over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The odd smile lingering about her lips, she pulled the door
slowly between them and was gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sense of void surged over him, in a sickening sweep. He
fell back upon the pillow with a suppressed groan. She had
gone, misunderstanding in her heart. To explain fully and
in detail would be the act of a cad, an act of which even he
was incapable. For a moment his very center of gravity
seemed to disintegrate. Then came the familiar blankness
of despair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />LIFE’S GLAMOUR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With the death of her husband, freedom had descended
upon Anne like a gift of the gods. A divine ointment,
it penetrated her bruised spirit, allaying the stored-up
bitterness of years. Her heart emptied itself of poison and
welled with compassion for the pitiful ending of a futile life.
As her husband lay back upon the pillows, broken beyond all
aid, unbelievably aged, she almost forgave the insult to her
youth that their common life had proved. If it had only
been a case of disparity of age, no question of forgiveness
would have existed at all. The twenty odd years between
them might have been forged into the strongest instead of
the weakest link that bound them together. It was this very
disparity, in fact, which at first had attracted her to him,
with the enormous flattery it implied. Her immaturity had
thrilled to the condescension as it could never thrill for the
horde of barbaric youngsters who formed the guard-gallant
of her first New York season. Emerging from an environment
entirely continental, she was accustomed to the attentions
of men belonging to an older race, whose suave courtesy
had its roots in the antique. From the consulates in Rome
and Florence which her father had occupied ingloriously but
with utter content, she had brought an old-world respect and
appreciation for maturity utterly foreign to young America of
even fifteen years ago. And in these respects Julius Schuyler
had satisfied her entirely. In her eyes he was not only a
polished, traveled and well-read man of the world, he was
brilliant. He dominated. His sketches were not the mere
fads of a supremely idle and blasé man. They flamed with
talent. Their very unfinished condition proved it. When
so much can be suggested by the mere sweep of a line, why
satiate the spectator further? So she had accepted him at her
own adolescent valuation, glowing dewily beneath his tired,
vivacious gaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>For it was his forte to be sprightly. The ready repartee
was ever on his lips, nor was the pun scorned. No matter
how trite, how forced the shaft, it played the most important
rôle in his armory. To the ears of eighteen the
pompous straining was inaudible, the weary dissatisfaction
which it served to conceal, practically invisible. It was not
until the forcing-house of marriage, the constant companionship,
had opened her eyes that she glimpsed the actual man
through the shallow smoke-screen behind which he strove to
cover an aching ennui, an intolerable insufficiency.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile his admiration had gone completely to her
young head. The fumes of it were sweet to her unaccustomed
nostrils. Almost before she was aware of it, she had
consented to marry him. So it came about that before the end
of her first season she had acquired a husband twenty-five
years her senior, still active, distinguished in appearance,
although already gray, and incidentally wealthy, besides whose
fortune her father’s very comfortable means dwindled
ludicrously.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet perhaps it had not been so bad in the long run.
After all, Julius Schuyler had been a gentleman and always
acquitted himself as such. For Anne there had been no brutality,
no animalism to encounter. Only the monotony of
an endless and artificial vivacity, the ever forcing of herself
to keep up her rôle of amused and humble spectator and
playmate.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was so small, so finicky, with his endless devices for
passing the time. His double solitaire, his dominoes, his
checkers which he would always produce at the hint of an
empty half hour. Multi-subterfuges for cheating the gnawing
ennui which with the years had fastened itself upon him
like a cancer. Disliking all games intensely, Anne had at
first absolutely refused to share in these puerile feints against
time. But, after a while, when all effort at conversation
languished in the anæmic soil of his irritating triteness, she
had capitulated. They played checkers in Amalfi, his back
turned to the glorious bay, her subconscious bathing in its
blue flame; dominoes in Luxor with the Tombs of the Kings
beckoning on the glamorous horizon line; two-handed bridge
on the terrace of their villa in Florence, while the setting sun
tinted the Arno and set afire the mammoth dome of the old
cathedral.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, there had been compensations. The silver lining
to her cloud had provided a background of decided luxury.
Travel brought contact with a cosmopolitan, ever-changing,
group who gave the beautiful American that delicate homage,
tinged with desire, which is stimulating to a feminine ego,
dissatisfied and unawakened. Intervals between <i>tête-à-tête</i>
games were sometimes brilliant and prolonged. The buying
of the villa in Florence was a joy, almost unmitigated by the
fussy alterations of Julius who imagined he understood old
furniture, and the <i>Cinque-Cento</i>. It was sheer rapture to
return to Florence, to resume old friendships, revisit in stealth
old haunts.</p>

<p class='c008'>But her vitality was sapped by Julius’ greedy monopoly.
He clung with the persistency of an <i>âme damnée</i>. He accompanied
her to the dressmaker, where she was draped according
to his finicky conception of her type. He chose her hats. He
bought her underwear, all of the very finest, of course. But
when she wore it beneath his complacent eyes, self-consciousness
became an agony which habit refused to dull. If
passion had underlain the complacence, she would not have
minded even this. But Julius never forgot himself in his
love for her. His natural diffidence was a perpetual audience,
the unwelcome third in all their intercourse. Never impulsive,
his caresses lacked the white heat of passion which is
clean because spontaneous. Beneath his touch, Anne felt herself
perpetually under the microscope. It seemed as if he
were vain, not of his prowess, but of still being capable of
harboring sensation at all. And habit made her quick to
notice that these lapses into anæmic appetite usually followed
the prodding of some erotic book or play, and were seldom
occasioned by her own desirability. She became practiced in
the art of retreat and withdrawal, so that the whole nature
of love was distorted. Still, a sort of pity for his maimed
spirit kept her silent. She closed her eyes and tried deliberately
to become callous. However, she made up her mind
that if so precious a commodity as freedom ever came within
her grasp again, she would never permit it to escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now that this freedom had been hers for almost five
years, its realization had exceeded her keenest expectations.
Evading every opportunity of remarriage, she had skilfully
apportioned her seasons between the United States and Europe.
The New York season was invariably followed by a few
weeks in Egypt or the Riviera and capped by three sensuous
months in the Florentine villa. And this was the best-loved
time of all, in which she renewed body and soul, absorbing
peace and serenity from the olive-crusted hills upon whose
sides multi-colored villas gleamed like jewels in dark tresses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within her small but cherished garden, rose a terrace paved
with bricks. One attained it by a narrow flight of moss-grown
steps. Here she would sit for hours, basking beneath
the sun which rode the heavens like an impartial god, while
beyond the pallid balustrade, cypress-studded hills merged into
the horizontal purple.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here it was that she received her friends for tea, listening
indulgently to lascivious, Tuscan, gossip. Then, alone once
more, after her late dinner, or companioned by the man of
the hour, it was here she would pace up and down in the
sweet-scented dusk while myriads of fireflies like a flaming
milky way disbanded at her approach. And high above the
swarthy cypresses the sun’s paramour, the moon, shamelessly
flaunted in his reflected rays.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those were enchanted nights into which Julius’s memory
intruded like the sordid wraith from another existence; a
warning wraith with finger on lips, whose image tempered
Anne’s blood. Not that she was discreet, for that was a
quality Anne had never troubled to acquire. In fact, her
dealings were so recklessly above-board that she was suspected
of untold depths of wickedness. A beautiful woman
who paces under the stars at midnight with now one man,
now another, cannot hope to escape slander.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although perfectly aware of this fact, Anne chose to
ignore it. Even the nominal chaperonage of some poor, but
genteel, relative seemed insupportable to the fierce and rapturous
reaction through which she was passing. She remained
defiantly alone. Her charm, her elegance, and most certainly
her wealth (in that way Florentines are most human)
carried her through. But rumor was building a wall of
eccentricity about her and she was rapidly becoming known,
both on the Continent and in America, as rather terrifyingly
individual, and an image-breaker.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most conservative began to drop off almost imperceptibly,
leaving a large circle of spirits who prided themselves
upon a freedom akin to looseness, and a small band of
intimates too close to be affected by the whispers of the scurrilous.
Among the latter, the Marchese Torrigiani and his
mother refused steadfastly to believe anything but the best of
Anne. Their friendship of years continued undisrupted, and
both mother and son looked forward with eagerness to the
day when Anne would weary of her precarious liberty, and
consent to become Vittorio’s wife. But although she admitted
to an affection for Vittorio which at times flickered
into transient tenderness, her marriage with Julius had developed
a complex which made it impossible for her to contemplate
the subject without a shrinking horror. Meanwhile the
Marchese waited, hoping almost against hope, that with the
passing of time the lacerating memory would fade away.
But so far it had refused to do so and there were hours when
it seemed to the steadfast man as if the scar were branded
into Anne’s very soul. Accepting his homage as a matter of
course, she had continued to drift along the path of least
resistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>But latterly, a new restlessness was creeping in, and life
had somehow lost its savour. The New York season was
becoming a grind. Her friends were either blatantly rich,
meretricious and over-fed, mere excitement chasers, or else
pretenders, <i>art fainéants</i>, who dabbled in cubes and sex.
Neurotic composers who dribbled mediocrities over the piano
keys. Pseudo writers who reveled in the drab, perhaps
because any further flight was beyond their stunted wings.
Anne was growing to hate them all, and herself the most,
because she had remained too indolent or too powerless to
rise above their level. There were superior beings, of course,
who were achieving the real thing somewhere. But they
dwelt on a different plane, in a workers’ world of their own,
whose fastnesses she had never as yet been able to scale. Her
music was good, even excellent, almost professional, but that
irritating adverb “almost” rose like an impassable Chinese
wall, thrusting her forever into the destinationless region of
the dilettantes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beautiful, brilliant, talented, she remained negligible in
her own hypercritical eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>To oust this growing dissatisfaction which had sifted into
the indolent drift of her life and was gradually embittering
it, Anne had literally taken to her heels. Two weeks alone
with the mountains had brought a certain serenity. Already
the miserly future looked less blank. Soothed by solitudes
and distance, her inflamed ego was content to sink into the
great whole. After all, there were compensations. She
might not be a genius, but that did not prevent genius from
existing! And personality was only an illusion after all, a
hollow shell, within which the Great Spirit differentiated.
Who was she to grumble in the the face of this universal oneness,
into which her littleness merged so superbly? The healing
breath of the forest swept her clean of vanity. Her soul
rejoiced in the vigor of its new-found simplicity. She spent
her days roaming in the woods, or paddling about in a canoe
on the unrippled waters of the chaste little lake. She re-read
one or two favorite books, but all the time her mind remained
contentedly empty and receptive, like an airing room whose
windows are unclosed to the winds of heaven.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in this mood she had come upon the hut and
Alexis. Her sleeping self had reawakened and once more
taken her into possession. But it was a rested and less
inverted self, a younger and more ingenuous self, who still
admitted the futility of happiness but dimly craved it. In
her present chastened mood she was determined to oust the
personal factor. There had been too much of that in all
her previous dealings with men. It had always been to that
quality of pervasive femininity to which they had succumbed,
and consciously or unconsciously, she had never failed to
assert it. She was going to change all that. Here was a
boy, probably ten years her junior, whose plight would arouse
the sympathy of the veriest egotist. Whose unhappiness, combined
with his genius, stirred the stagnant pool of her soul.
Her quickened spirit responded to his need with almost
complete self-forgetfulness. That genius should come to her
door in the guise of a postulant, just as she herself had
become resigned to her own lack of it, seemed the culminating
miracle to her new-found peace of mind. To heal
this bruised spirit and send it back to the world in the glory
of renewed splendor was her job. And nothing less than
success would satisfy her. For once she would step out of
the amateur class and prove that she could do one thing
thoroughly and well, even if it were so infinitesimal a thing
as the rescue of a soul.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />THE PAWN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was one of those crystal October days, when the air is
crisp and clean, tempered by a kindly sun and Central
Park is etched in russet and gold against a sky of opalescent
clouds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Huddled against the cushions of a high window seat, Claire
gazed down upon it all from the eleventh story of the huge
apartment building in 59th Street where she and Mme.
Petrovskey had been installed for the last year. It was the
customary, rather sumptuous, decidedly characteristic studio
apartment which they had been in the habit of occupying for
the last five or six years, ever since Alexis had commenced
to be known. Walnut paneling, canopied bed, old blue brocade
covers and hangings, reeked of the interior decorator;
the only personal touches which had survived Claire’s listlessness
being a carved ivory rosary hanging over the bedpost, a
few French and Italian novels of the emotional school, and
a large photograph of Alexis which scowled out upon the
world from the dressing table.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first glance, the crouching girl upon the window seat
seemed as nondescript as the room. Almost frighteningly
fragile in her dark street dress, she would have been entirely
insignificant if it had not been for the appalling misery of
her eyes. They brimmed with the sorrowfulness of a kicked
puppy. In their heavy-lidded gaze was mirrored the atavistic
agony of womankind. Weary, all-revealing, they stared
down upon the brilliant park below, while she listlessly
stroked the bizarre head of a Brussels Griffon curled upon
her skirts.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the creature next to Alexis which she loved the best
in the world, both because Alexis had bought it for her himself
on a sudden boyish impulse, and because it loved her with
all the devotion in its tiny body. And love was to Claire the
food and drink for which her soul was starving. Not that
she had ever been cruelly treated. Hers had been a negative
sort of misery. When she was a child of six, her mother
had died, leaving her in the charge of her aunt, Mme.
Petrovskey, in whose boarding house they were then living.
Of her father she knew nothing. But sometimes she suspected
his official existence. All she knew was that her name
was the same as that of her aunt before she had married
Nicholas Petrovskey, that strange and exotic Russian musician,
who had invaded the boarding house one day before she herself
was born, and had never left it until his death several
years later.</p>

<p class='c008'>How well she remembered that boarding house in old
London. How scrupulously clean and unutterably dreary it
had all been! And how well she remembered her aunt’s
foreign husband who filled the house from morning till night
with the weird sobbings of his violin, until it almost seemed
to her child’s understanding that one were not in a London
boarding house at all, but in an enchanted castle which continually
bewailed its pristine glories. It was this music and the
author of it which had supplied the only romance of a childhood
singularly dull and colorless. And strange to say, the
frail, emaciated figure of the musician stood out more clearly
in her memory than that of his little boy Alexis, who had
been her playmate ever since the beginning of things. It was
not until several years later, when his father had died and
Alexis was almost ten years old, that he had become the
greatest interest and only affection of her lonely little life.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then the music had come between them. He was
always at his violin and the old house echoed plaintively as
in the years gone by; only as Claire grew older the wailing
ceased to be fairy strains and seemed to be flowing from her
own over-charged heart. Then they had suddenly sold the
boarding house and gone to Berlin, where Alexis’ ambitious
mother had put him under one of the best masters. Followed
years of traveling and recitals while the boy’s fame
grew and spread until the outbreak of the great war, when
Alexis was fourteen and she a few months younger. They
had come to the United States and made it more or less their
headquarters while they toured South America, Mexico, and
the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, at the age of twenty-three, Alexis was an idol, not
only in every large city of the United States, but in Paris and
London as well. Since the end of the war they had returned
to the Continent several times and it was while on a visit to
Paris, five or six years before, that Alexis had bought Bébé
for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>How well Claire remembered it all. He had been away
almost all day, playing for the wounded soldiers in Auteuil
and had returned to the hotel downcast and tragic, as always
after the sight of the brave <i>poilus</i>. She had induced him to
go for a walk and had led him along the arcade in the Rue de
Rivoli as people and shops always amused and distracted him.
They had passed by a dog-fancier’s and he had insisted upon
going in and buying for her the small Brussels Griffon which
stared at them with bulging and egocentric eyes from the
shop window. They had been quite gay when they returned
to the hotel with the new member of the family, saying they
had been married and acquired progeny in the short space of
an hour and a half. Mme. Petrovskey had watched them
grimly, a strange look in her small eyes, and perhaps, who
knows, at least Claire had always imagined that it was then
that she conceived the idea of their marriage? But it was
not until years after, six months ago in fact, that it had
actually occurred, and then so quietly, so almost clandestinely,
that it had hardly seemed like a marriage at all. Except for
necessary witnesses, the small chapel had been deserted, the
priest a stranger. Claire had timidly requested for old Father
Gregory to officiate. But her aunt’s manner had been so
unapproachable that she had not dared to insist. And Alexis
so unlike himself that he had scarcely spoken to her for days,
barely said more than a few words, in fact, since the night
she had gone to his room and Mme. Petrovskey had found
her there and acted so strangely. And yet there had been
nothing wrong in her going to Alexis like that. She had
often done so in the years gone by, especially after a concert,
when she knew it would be hours before his tension
could relax into sleep. She would sit beside the bed and rub
his burning forehead, and they would talk a little in soft
whispers, not because they feared his mother might hear, but
so as not to break the calm which was stealing over him.
Time and time again Alexis had fallen asleep beneath her
fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so, on this particular night, when she heard the restless
pacing in the room near hers, it had been purely instinctive
to get up and go to his aid. And indeed he had seemed
glad to see her as usual, that is until her aunt had come in
upon them and ordered her out so peremptorily. She never
knew exactly what passed between them, although the sound
of their muffled voices had penetrated to her room for almost
an hour, and she herself had not been able to sleep all night
for sheer bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next day Alexis had come to her and asked her to
marry him. His face was very pale and his manner more
distant than she had ever known it, not with the familiar
absent-minded air behind which she knew lurked affection and
kindness, but vested with a new hostile courtesy that would
have struck her as sinister if she had not been too utterly
dazed with joy to be analytical.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since then she had often wondered in secret, and an icy
fear had invaded her at times. Could Mme. Petrovskey
have had anything to do with it? Was it possible that she
had forced Alexis to ask her to marry him, because she had
discovered them together in his room? But if that was the
case, would he not have told her about it in one of those
unguarded moments when it seemed as if her love had suddenly
struck flint to his steel? One of those abandoned
moments when he lay in her arms with closed eyes, identity
swamped in a vast surge of primitive passion? Ah, yes, he
would have told her then. The alternative was too horrible
to contemplate. She shuddered. The months passed like a
delirious moment. Perched on a see-saw of rapture and
terror, she had been flung to the heavens and then plunged
into the abyss according to Alexis’ moods. And he had
become more eccentric every day. His passion, spasmodic
from the first, had quickly degenerated into the old absent-minded
kindliness at best. At times, his irritability had been
frightful, but she had always excused it, attributing everything
to nerves, constantly strained from excitement and
overwork. Then had come his breakdown in Carnegie Hall
and the collapse of the world. The doctors had sent him to
a sanitarium in the mountains and all had gone well for a
few weeks. Until about ten days ago when Alexis had disappeared
suddenly off the face of the earth, since when Claire
and his mother had existed on the verge of despair. Of
course, Mme. Petrovskey had tried to keep it quiet, but it had
leaked out as things always do, and the newspapers had been
headlining it for the last week.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus it was that Claire’s eyes, always plaintive at best,
brimmed with the age-old sorrow of the world, and she lay
upon the window-sill, heavy with misery, recalling the scenes
of childhood, clinging pitifully to their memory like an old
woman for whom life has already withdrawn all hope of a
future. While at her side, his small soul vaguely troubled,
the Griffon whined and tugged at her skirts. Her weary eyes
falling upon him presently, a sudden pity seized her for his
helplessness. Her hand closed fondly upon his small head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Bébé,” she murmured, following the little dog’s
longing glance into the street below. “Shall I take you for
a walk?”</p>

<p class='c008'>At her words, he leaped up into her face rapturously, his
furry body vibrant with joyful tail-waggings. She smiled
wanly at his eagerness. “Poor Bébé, I’ve neglected you,
haven’t I? But I’m so miserable, so miserable!” She caught
him up in her arms and hugged him to her so tightly that he
yelped in shrill remonstrance. Setting him down with a
patient smile she sat down at her toilet table and put on her
hat, an uninteresting dark blue turban which emphasized
disastrously her insignificance.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she met her weary eyes in the mirror, her pallor deepened.
“No wonder Alexis couldn’t love me,” she exclaimed
in a bitter whisper. “I am ugly, no——” she paused, beating
her little fist upon the toilet table. “I am worse than ugly,
I am nothing, nobody! How could I expect to hold a genius,
a man of fire? And now,” she bent her head upon her arms
and burst into low, suppressed weeping, “he is lost, perhaps
dead! But I can’t believe it,” she raised her head and gazed
at her reflection savagely. “He is not dead, he is only hiding
somewhere—from her,” she added in a tense whisper. “From
us both! Perhaps he has met another woman whom he can
really love. If that should happen I wonder what I would
do? Kill her? God knows I would want to!” The
clenched fists rose to her mouth in a passionate gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little dog tugged at her skirts. An odd smile upon her
lips, she controlled herself with an effort, caught up gloves
and bag and led him out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they reached the entrance-hall, the doorbell whirred
noisily. Claire’s heart leaped, and then fell leadenly. Could
it, might it be Alexis, at last?</p>

<p class='c008'>Ito opened the door. A chauffeur was standing there, a
letter in his hand. With a gasp of disappointment Claire
signed to the Jap to give it to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was from Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>The beloved hieroglyphics sprawled before her eyes in a
happy mist. Addressed not to herself but to Mme. Petrovskey,
they gave her a momentary pang, that vanished quickly
beneath the certainty of Alexis’ safety. She spoke to the
man as steadily as she could.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there—any answer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He hesitated. “I don’t think so, but I can wait if you
like.” He stepped through a doorway and sat down gingerly
upon a chair which Claire pointed out to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>A joyful tattoo beating against her ribs, Claire ran down
the long vaulted corridor and knocked upon the door of Mme.
Petrovskey’s study.</p>

<p class='c008'>A deep voice boomed permission to enter. Claire burst
into the room almost violently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a letter from Alexis, Aunt. Do please read it and
tell me what he says!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give it to me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A large woman, seated at a roll-top desk, revolved round
in her chair, took the letter without a word and started to
read it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hands clasped tightly together, Claire watched her eagerly.
It was one of those bland, non-committal faces, full and
inclined to be weather-beaten, which are often called motherly
because they top a large motherly body, and have the smooth
expressionless surface of a rag doll. But Claire knew the
face very well indeed, had studied it since childhood, so that
the minutest pinching of the puckered lips, the slightest increase
in color, spoke volumes. And the letter was evidently
disturbing indeed, judging from the mottled purple on her
aunt’s cheeks, the angry clutch of the broad fingers upon the
crumpled sheets.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Mme. Petrovskey turned the last page she laid the letter
deliberately upon the desk, and turned her back upon Claire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” faltered the girl. “Is Alexis all right and is—is
he coming back soon? Shall I tell the chauffeur to wait for
your answer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is no answer!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The voice was harsh and self-contained. For the first time
she looked at Claire, who shrank beneath the stare of the
small glassy eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing in here?” she asked, pinching her lips.
“Where you know you are not permitted, you and your dog?”
she added with a contemptuous glare, at the microscopic
Griffon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire stooped and gathered Bébé up in her arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The—the letter, it is from Alexis!” she stammered.
“Please—please read it to me, Aunt!” She trembled visibly
at her own boldness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her evident fear irritated Mme. Petrovskey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it is from Alexis,” she replied glacially, “but there
is no message in it for you.” She revolved once more in her
chair, and commenced to write again fast and furiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>A low cry of despair and rage escaped Claire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are cruel,” she cried chokingly. “I have a right to
know! Am I not his wife!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The revolving chair remained immovable. Mme. Petrovskey
bent a purple face over her writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He says he is better, but is taking a further rest-cure, and
doesn’t wish us to know his address. He will communicate
with us later,” she replied in suppressed and uneven tones,
her obstinate back still turned upon the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire gasped with relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then when he is better, he will come back?” she insisted
in a firmer voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey threw her pen from her in a violent
gesture. The face she turned upon her niece was pale and
convulsed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is never coming back!” she cried with suppressed fury.
“He is going to manage his own life after this. He says
now that he cannot play the violin any more, he is free to
live as he likes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She rose to her feet, shadowing the stricken girl with her
enormous bulk. Her face stared stonily in front of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is what it has come to,” she muttered. “This is
his gratitude for a lifetime of devotion and sacrifice. I
have worked myself to the bone that his genius might have
every chance to develop. Now he throws me aside, as if I
were an outgrown toy, and tells me he is going to manage
his own life. He who couldn’t even make out a check for
himself or remember his own address!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Paralyzed with misery, Claire watched her aunt in a stupor
of surprise. This was the first time she had ever known her
to reveal any emotion stronger than contempt or a cold sort
of anger. And the sight was shattering. Gathering herself
together through sheer force of will, she helped her aunt
back into the chair and patted the large veined hand timidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He can’t mean it,” she murmured. “He has been like
this before, you know. He really couldn’t leave you. Why,
he’d be helpless all alone, and without his music.” She choked
back a sob. Alexis without his violin would be like another
man bereft of all five senses. “No, no, he’ll come back,”
she faltered pluckily. “Not for me. He doesn’t need me,
but for you, his mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey looked up into the piteous little face
with a sort of hard compassion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Claire,” she said more gently than she had spoken
to her for years, “I sacrificed you for nothing, didn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A slow blush spread over the girl’s transparent features.
She raised her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was no sacrifice,” she whispered. “It was my joy, my
glory. I—I have always loved him so!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then suddenly her eyes flashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If only we could write to him. If only we could get hold
of him and tell him how broken you are. It was cruel of
him not to leave us his address. Do you think we might
inveigle it out of the chauffeur? What do you think, Aunt?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That would be a confession of failure,” answered the
older woman. “Besides, you may be sure he was bound to
secrecy. Now, leave me, Claire. I must be alone. I want
to think. Take your dog and go out in the park. It will
do you good. Perhaps, who knows, things aren’t as hopeless
as they look?”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a sudden return of her imperious manner, she waved
Claire away. Heavy with dread, the girl put down Bébé,
fastened the leash on to his bright collar and left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The strange chauffeur was still waiting by the hall door.
He seemed her only hope now. She approached him with
trembling knees.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If—if you will tell me where Mr. Petrovskey is I will
make it worth your while,” she said with a pathetic assumption
of firmness.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stood up as she spoke. His nice blue eyes evaded hers
apologetically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry, miss, but my orders were not to say anything.
If there is no answer I must be going.” He fidgeted, one
hand on the door-knob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” she turned away to hide trembling lips.
“There is no answer. You may go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened the door and going out into the hall, rang
for the elevator. She looked after him hopelessly. Then a
sudden idea flashed like a ray of lightning into the black confusion
of her mind. She followed him out into the hall
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait a minute, I am going too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stood aside, as she entered the elevator in front of
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>They emerged into the pretentious entrance-hall and Claire,
still preceding him with Bébé in her arms went out into the
sun-lit street.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hand to his cap, the chauffeur jumped nimbly into a large
Cadillac by the curb and drove away. Claire looked after
him with an air of frightened triumph. A small pad in her
hand, she had hastily scrawled down the license number.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c009'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />CLAIRE’S RENUNCIATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For days the sun had shone brilliantly upon the mountainside,
and the lodge had long since emerged from its heavy
swathing of fog. No longer a boat floating through mystic
seas, it was divested of a certain glamour. But remained,
nevertheless, a very comfortable and picturesque shelter.
Perched pertly beside the road that overhung the valley, it
afforded a bird’s-eye view of checkered fields and a winding
river, that gleamed like a silver girdle about the base of purple
hills.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis revelled in the glorious sunshine. Weak, but quiescent
after his fever, he was content to sit on the rustic porch,
a rug about his knees, and gaze through the brilliant foliage
at the vivid valley, which sparkled in the thin autumn air
with all the detailed perfection of a mosaic.</p>

<p class='c008'>This particular morning was the most perfect of them all.
With a sigh of enjoyment Alexis stretched his limbs in a
perfection of relaxation which he had not known for years.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is strange,” he said, “how rested and peaceful I feel.
All the terrible irritability seems to have left me entirely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It went away with the fever-devil,” laughed Anne, who
was sketching a stunted pine beside the roadway. “A most
suitable match, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis laughed uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only hope it never returns,” he said, somewhat uneasily.
“Nerves have as many lives as a cat, you know, and an
unerring instinct for home. One never can tell when they will
spring upon one again from the dark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose the moral of that is to always keep a light
handy,” said Anne gaily, but with a quick glance of pity
for the worn boyish face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all very well, but what if your stock of matches
has run out and you’re groping about in the dark?” he exclaimed
whimsically, but with a significant tightening of
the lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne leaned over and laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you must ask someone else to give you a light,”
she said softly. He caught her fingers in his and pressed
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some good Samaritan like you,” he cried. His eyes filled
with nervous tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne drew her hand away quietly. This sort of thing
was not to be encouraged if she were to obtain the impersonal
influence over him which she had intended from the first.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is very pretty, but I don’t deserve it,” she said lightly.
“Come, tell me more about yourself. I want to know all
about your life. It must be thrilling to be a genius!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He smiled mournfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thrilling, I should say not! It is the most narrow life
possible. At least mine has been so. Merely a record of
travel and hard work. When I was a child we were never
long enough in any one place to make any friends, besides
my mother always feared they would interfere with my practicing,
and later, I had become so pent-up within myself and
my music that I had no further desire for them. Claire was
the only person I ever saw, outside of my mother, and most
of the time I was practically unconscious of her existence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Claire—is that your wife?” inquired Anne in spite of
herself. She blocked in the background of her sketch with
nervous strokes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he cast her a quick, guilty glance. Then, after a
pause, “You mustn’t think I meant all the rotten things I
said about her the other night. I’ve always been very fond
of the poor little thing, only as a wife she meant nothing to
me. I suppose you wonder why I married her, and I admit
it must seem pitiably weak, only I was in such a state at
the time that I really wasn’t responsible. Everything was a
nightmare of jangled nerves.” The vision of his mother
threatening to put Claire out upon the streets if he refused
to marry her, came before him. An uneven flush spread
over his face. His hands clenched the arms of the chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sometimes I wonder if there isn’t a taint of madness in
me somewhere, a rotten spot in my brain that is spreading——”
He threw out his hands in a gesture of despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>She met the frantic appeal in his eyes with firm denial.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re talking introspective drivel. Summoning prehistoric
monsters out of your subconscious cavern. Don’t let
yourself be frightened by a few dead bones. There is neither
madness nor method about you. You are simply too highly
organized for your own comfort. In other words, you are a
genius and must pay the penalty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed more naturally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So in your opinion every genius must be a poor fool?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“According to some standards, yes. He was made to walk
on the heights, and when he is forced to descend to the valley
and mingle with the rest of us his head often remains in the
clouds, and he stumbles woefully.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t count yourself in with the rest of them, for
heaven’s sakes!” exclaimed Alexis, his eyes hypnotized by the
bronze aureole of her hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>She encountered his gaze with a poised smile which for
some inexplicable reason, angered him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But unfortunately, or fortunately, that is precisely where
I belong,” she said without a tinge of her old bitterness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may not have any talent for doing any one special
thing,” he interrupted hotly, “but you, yourself, are so perfect,
such a work of art. It must take genius to be just
you. Let us say you are genius in the abstract.” He smiled
at her in sheer pleasure at his own happy phrase.</p>

<p class='c008'>She rose and putting her sketch on the table, smiled down
upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re only a baby, after all, aren’t you? I think I
shall call you my changeling. Come, changeling, how would
you like to take a little stroll down to the lake? It is only
a moment’s walk from here. We will take some cushions
and you can lie back in my canoe and I’ll paddle you about
for a while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stood up eagerly and held out his arms for the gay
cushions which she threw at him from the chaise-longue.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall have to learn how to walk all over again,” he
laughed as they started down the steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t I say you were a baby?” She took his arm with
a protecting gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>They strolled slowly forward while the brilliant foliage
flaunted high overhead and formed an exotic carpet beneath
their feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>From an upper window Regina looked after them and
shook a disapproving head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Dio mio</i>, it begins all over again,” she sighed, “and this
time with a babe! Will she never be content to settle down?
And I who had such fine hopes for the Signor Marchese, so
rich and so very respectable!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>There’s an intimacy about a canoe which once shared, can
change a slight acquaintance into something warm and perhaps
enduring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne and Alexis had reached a focus where it seemed to
fuse their points of contact perilously. Not that either of
them had analyzed it as yet. Alexis as he lay back upon his
cushions, was conscious only of the beauty of burnished hair,
glamorous eyes and skin, of the god-like frame of trees and
lake and sky; the unutterable bliss of such companionship in
such surroundings. To him it was like a divine interlude
from Purgatory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne was more experienced in such affairs. Her instinct
had long ago hinted of danger. But she chose to ignore it,
trusting to practice and <i>savoir faire</i> to avoid forthcoming
pitfalls. As before, she determined to remain mistress of
the situation. But it was only natural that the boy’s budding
worship should stir her. After all, he was no ordinary young
man but a genius with a power to move thousands, and had,
moreover, a compelling, if somewhat neurotic, personal appeal.
And he possessed one quality which Anne had never
been able to resist. That of physical beauty. With the classical
features of a Greek faun, he combined a fragility, a
certain decadent charm, which intrigued her fatigued senses.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the morning flew by with flashing swiftness. All too
soon, they were crunching back over the regal carpet of tinted
leaves which showered down upon their heads from the trees
like a flock of brittle butterflies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel like Danae,” laughed Anne, as she shook down a
golden cluster from a branch above her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis regarded her ecstatically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They match your hair exactly. But alas, I am not
Jupiter. I cannot pour myself upon you in a golden rain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His eyes met hers with a new audacity. “But I’ll dissolve
into tears, which will amount to the same thing, if you
look at me like that!” he added hastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne hated herself for flushing. She averted her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You absurd boy! Come, we must hurry, or Regina’s
lunch will be spoiled. It’s so nice and warm today, she
promised to serve it on the porch. Won’t that be jolly? It’s
supposed to be a great surprise, but I suspect a <i>risotto à la
Milanese</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She led the way to the house. A puzzled frown between
his straight brows, Alexis followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are in a great hurry,” he said, in hurt tones. “You
forget the baby is still learning to walk!” His voice was
plaintive in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned about in quick repentance. His laughing eyes
were roguish.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Changeling!” she murmured. She disdained the arm he
held out in feigned weakness. “What shall I do with you,
you are incorrigible!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a note of triumph in his laugh. Taking her
arm masterfully in his, he looked down upon her teasingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The lady lion-tamer mustn’t mind a scratch or two, especially
in the beginning, before the animals learn how to behave
nicely.” He mocked, but the light in his eyes was tender.</p>

<p class='c008'>Annoyed and amused, Anne laughed in spite of herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Touchée</i>,” she admitted gaily, “I see the cub is developing
teeth and a mane, and I’d better look out for myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis tightened her arm against his side. He emitted a
low, but ferocious growl. With a laugh and a delicate shiver,
she freed herself deftly and ran up the cottage steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, lunch isn’t ready after all——” she commenced, and
then stopped short, for finger on lips, like a sibyl, Regina
stood in the doorway and pointed mysteriously towards the end
of the porch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Astonished and amused, Anne’s eyes followed the melodramatic
finger. At the end of the verandah sat a small
limp figure. What a bore, who could it possibly be? She
had not given her address to a soul, and not even her mail
was being forwarded. Couldn’t people ever leave one alone?</p>

<p class='c008'>But she moved forward graciously as usual.</p>

<p class='c008'>The small figure rose at her approach. A pale face, a
pair of enormous haunted eyes, confronted Anne. An inexplicable
spasm contracted Anne’s heart. She concealed sudden
apprehension beneath a formal nod, and waited for the
other to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl commenced timidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this Mrs. Schuyler?” she inquired in a low, uneven
voice. The soft brown eyes met Anne’s. “I came to——”
then she stopped short, with a breathless gasp. Her glance
had swept beyond Anne and lighted upon Alexis, just as he
stepped on to the porch.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden flush beautified the wan little face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis!” she cried and brushed past Anne tempestuously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis,” she repeated. “I had to come. Please forgive
me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Claire!” Alexis gazed at her stormily.</p>

<p class='c008'>She approached him pleadingly. “Is that all you have to
say to me, Alexis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you expect me to say?” he braced himself
visibly, “except that I am speechless with surprise?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Drawing forward a porch chair, he motioned her toward
it. “Won’t you sit down? It is a long journey from New
York and you must be tired.” His voice was cold with
restrained anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her knees bent beneath her, and she sank into the chair
with a tired sigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Alexis,” the small voice was pathetic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I forget,” Alexis added as Anne approached them
rather hesitatingly, “this is my hostess, Mrs. Schuyler. Mrs.
Schuyler, my wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl rose and bowed formally. Then fell back into
her chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne came to her side. With quick pity, saying the first
thing that came into her head. “It’s a frightful trip up here,
isn’t it? You must be simply starving, I will order luncheon
immediately.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was about to enter the house, but Claire stopped her
with a quick little gesture of refusal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, that is very kind. But I really couldn’t eat
anything—that is——-” she faltered bravely. “I had a sandwich
on the train.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her pathetic attempt at dignity went to Anne’s heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, of course,” she said, “and now if you will
excuse me, I will leave you two alone. I’m sure you have
a great deal to talk about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a nod and a kind little smile, she disappeared into
the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her perfect exit irritated Claire. With a sudden excess
of pride, she turned to Alexis and looked at him coldly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re very fortunate in your hostess,” she said with
unexpected poise. “How did you happen to meet her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis sat down on the railing and faced his wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a long story, Claire, but not so strange as you probably
imagine. I was ill when Mrs. Schuyler found me, and
she was good enough to take me in. She is a charming
woman,” he continued tactlessly. “And very <i>comme il
faut</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I have no doubt about that,” Claire interrupted bitterly.
“Very <i>comme il vous faut</i>, I am sure.” Her emphasis
of the “<i>vous</i>” was both angry and insulting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis sprang to his feet with an exclamation of rage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How dare you insinuate such a thing, Claire?” he darted
an angry glance toward the doorway. “Mrs. Schuyler is an
angel!” he finished with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire winced beneath the adoration in his tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You love her, don’t you?” she said wistfully. Her great
hopeless eyes rested on his flushed face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Completely startled, he rose to his feet and stood over her
almost menacingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Five minutes ago I didn’t know it,” he announced brutally,
“it remained for you to teach me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I!” The cry was wrung from blanched lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>He met her anguished eyes with insolence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, if you will be so good as to tell me what you
came for,” he began, “and how you discovered my whereabouts.
Did the chauffeur——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no. He didn’t say a word. I took down the number
of the car, and then, it was fairly easy for your mother to
discover the rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so she sent you after me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head, miserably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no. She really didn’t want me to come. But I had
to. I felt I must talk to you once more. But please don’t
think I have come for myself, I haven’t. I don’t want you
to come back to me if—if you don’t wish to. I know you
have never loved me.” She paused, then continued, “It is
only for your mother’s sake that I am here. She is entirely
broken up since your letter. Please, please.” She got up and
coming close to him, clasped his arm. “Please return to her!
If you don’t, I’m sure something dreadful will happen. I
never saw her so upset in my life. She is really ill, Alexis.”
He withdrew his arm, but not ungently. The girl’s unselfishness
had touched him in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I simply cannot return, Claire. My mother has dominated
me too long, and my soul aches for freedom. After this I
must be my own master. It’s not as if she really cared for me
personally. All I meant to her was my career and what it
brought in!” he ended bitterly. “Tell her that is finished
forever, and she will be quite satisfied to do without me. For
of what use is a dry cow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed sardonically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tears streaming down her face, Claire answered brokenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It breaks my heart to hear you speak so about your
music, you who lived for nothing else. Oh, my poor Alexis,
what madness has come over you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked before him with bewildered eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is gone, gone forever,” he muttered. “Can’t you see
it is torturing me, too?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His shattered look lurked so near to madness that once more
Claire forgot herself. She started up with a cry and threw
her arms about him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Alexis, don’t give up like that. Go back. Try once
more. If you find yourself again in your old surroundings,
it may all return to you. I’m sure you will be able to come
to some arrangement with your mother, which will leave you
more independent, and as for me I promise to do anything
you ask. If it will make you happier, and make you feel
less tied, I’ll go away somewhere, and you need never see
me again!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A cry of pity broke from his lips. He placed her back in
her chair. “Poor little Claire, it hurts to hear you talk like
that. Did you think it was you who had driven me from
home? Why, I shall remember your affection and sweetness
always.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A flash of joy irradiated her face as he spoke. He continued
with an effort.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But even you, whom I have always loved as a little
sister,” he emphasized the last word, “even you couldn’t bring
me home. Do you understand, Claire?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded slowly. Her pallor, if possible, increased.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you wish a separation?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>His heart contracted at her lifeless tone. He evaded her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Claire. I think it would be best. I must be free.
And you’ll admit our marriage was rather a farce, wasn’t it?”
He tried to speak lightly, but the effort was palpable even to
Claire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t know that it was, but perhaps you are right,” she
assented with a sort of deathly quiet. Her veins seemed to
be suddenly sucked dry of blood, her limbs became reed-like.
After a dragging moment she spoke. Her mouth was
dry, and it was difficult to enunciate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must be time to go back to the station,” she said somewhat
thickly. “My taxi is waiting around at the back of
the house. Will you please call it, Alexis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you can’t go like this, without talking things over.
Besides, you’re not fit to go back yet. You look done up.
You ought really to spend the night here!” His tone was
full of compunction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The words sent a quick revulsion through her. An indignant
strength flowed through her weakened limbs. She rose
to her feet almost violently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, Alexis. You can’t mean what you are saying. I
must return at once. I couldn’t bear to stay another minute.
If there’s anything to talk over, any arrangements to make, you
can write me. Please, please call my car at once!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Alexis still hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not want to part in anger and I can’t bear to have
you not understand——” he glanced deprecatingly towards
the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>She forced herself to smile at him valiantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is all right, Alexis. I quite understand. She is
both good and lovely.” She faltered pitifully. “Be happy
if you can. I want you to be!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out a tiny, trembling hand and he kissed it with
affection and regret.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment more, and the dust from her taxi rose in a
white cloud between the gleaming valley and his smarting eyes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />DARK DESPAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a six mile drive to the station. Cleaving to the lip
of the precipice, the road wound into the cup of the valley,
where toy-like houses gleamed white from out checkered
fields, and the serpentine river writhed sinuously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heedless of stones and ruts, Claire’s taxi swayed recklessly
onward. Wan, drawn, she huddled in the back seat,
clinging mechanically whenever a bump threatened to precipitate
her into the ravine below. Clinging mechanically and
instinctively only, for lurking destruction held no terror now.
Indeed, had she been conscious of the dangerous opportunity,
she would probably have permitted herself to be flung
to death several hundred feet below.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she was as impervious to her peril as to the beauty
about her. And every turn of the road revealed the valley
in a new vista. Unseen hills and forests emerged magically,
casting gorgeous patches of purple shadow before them.
Incense of balsam and fir rose to the heavens in heady
draughts like distilled sunshine. But Claire, swathed in her
garment of misery, saw, felt nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>With Alexis lost to her forever, life offered a terrifying
nothingness. She realized perhaps for the first time what
he had meant to her ever since she could remember. Without
him, existence would be a nightmare of emptiness, and
yet with every revolution of the wheels she was leaving him
further and further behind, progressing into the wintry region
of exile where lay her bleak future. And her days and years
had been so filled with his presence that it was almost impossible
for her to believe that this could be so. It was as if
some vital organ had been torn out of her living body and
she was expected to go on without it. It was humanly impossible!
In another moment she must speak to the driver,
tell him to turn back up the mountain before it was too late.
Back to Alexis and the beautiful, hateful woman, whom he
had grown to love—this superior goddess, this Brunhilde of
burnished tresses, who would have it all her own way on her
mountain top, above the clouds, while she herself rode down
into the dark valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she could not bring herself to utter the necessary word.
And she knew that it would never be spoken, trifle as she
might with the illusion. The unalterable had occurred. She
would make no further effort to mend the shattered pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>But how to face the lacerated future? To resume a
negative existence with a contemptuous aunt who had never
loved her and whom she had failed, would be beyond bearing.
To accept her charity and Alexis’ had not been difficult
before because she had made herself indispensable, and she
knew that she had more than earned her keep. Besides, she
had been Alexis’ only companion in his leisure moments and
he had depended upon her more than anyone realized. But
everything was changed. To continue to eat his bread and salt
would be unspeakable now that he loved another woman.
She had not only failed miserably as a wife, but he loved
another woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking blindly into the forest on either side, Claire repeated
the words to herself below her breath. “He loves another
woman.” They dinned into her soul with a persistency
that maddened, with the relentless monotony of the drop of
water which tortures the Chinese criminal. She crouched
further back into the seat and covered her ears. If the
repetition continued much longer, she would surely go mad, if she
had not done so already. The wheels took up the rhythm
and creaked it mockingly. As they rattled over the wooden
bridge and entered the village it rose to a hoarse shout. Then
with a jerk, stopped as suddenly and ominously as it had
commenced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire looked up startled, and saw they were at the station.
The New York train was already there, snorting impatiently.
She came to her senses with a bound, paid her
driver, got aboard the Pullman and in less than a minute was
leaving the country station and Alexis, as she told herself,
forever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Numbed by fatigue and suffering, the trip soon became a
nightmare of swift darkness. Heavy stupor descended upon
her. It was not until hours later, when skirting along the shores
of the Hudson, that she emerged to full consciousness. Night
had already fallen and the river heaved black and silver, like
a huge snake beneath the pale light of the stars. They were
stopping at a station near the water’s edge, and as Claire
peered out of the window, there came to her a violent temptation
to run down the corridor and leap out into the inky,
rippleless, depths. Why not? It would be the best thing that
could happen for everybody as well as for herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Life was hateful, bitter, terrifying. Here was, if not rest
and peace, at least cessation of agony. Her aunt would hardly
feel the difference and as for Alexis? He would be free
to marry again, and this time not blunderingly, like a dazed
unhappy child, but with his senses awakened, and for love. A
lump stabbed her in the throat like a dagger-thrust. She staggered
to her feet and started to lurch out into the aisle. There
came a sudden roaring as of a high wind and darkness fell
upon her.</p>

<p class='c008'>When consciousness returned, the train was entering the
Grand Central station. Life still clung heavily upon her
weary soul, but she was too torn, too utterly distraught to
think of any new means of self-destruction. She took a taxi
to the apartment in 59th Street and with the connivance of
Ito gained her room without her aunt’s knowledge. Welcomed
rapturously by the disconsolate Bébé, she fell upon the
bed fully clothed, and into the deep, dreamless, sleep of utter
exhaustion.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>She awakened towards morning, shocked into consciousness
by the upward surge of a hitherto suppressed and unbelievable
fear. Could it be possible that the uneasy suspicion which had
vaguely disturbed her for weeks, and which she had entirely
forgotten in the last twenty-four hours, was to be realized
after all? That would indeed be the climax of irony. But
it seemed to be the only explanation of the physical state
through which she was struggling. Nerves and anxiety
might account for general malaise and headaches. Fatigue
and an empty stomach for the faint on the train, but that was
not the first time she had lost consciousness in the last three
months, and she had other reasons besides to fear the worst.
The worst! To think that it should have to be called that,
when it should have proved so beautiful. To be the mother
of Alexis’ child, and to have to look forward to the fact with
shrinking and with shame. What could be more bitterly
ridiculous than that? And what would become of the baby
if it lived? Unwanted, unloved, it would probably lead the
same negative existence as she herself with all its joy dependent
upon one being, who would undoubtedly betray it in the
end. The thought brought scalding tears. Claire beat her
pillow with tiny fists. It was too much! She refused to
give birth to such ignominy.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a bound, she sprang from the bed and ran across
the room to the open window. Crouching upon the window
seat, she gazed down, wide-eyed and trembling, to where,
eleven stories below yawned the cavernous street. Her
stomach turned at the sight. But creeping flesh commanded
by indomitable spirit, she stumbled to her feet and stood upon
the sill. However, as soon as she did so, she realized her
mistake. To jump out, she would have to bend over almost
double, as the opening was not sufficiently high. It would
be necessary to sit and dangle her feet into the chasm. Somehow,
the idea seemed terrifying. Once more mastering her
shrinking body, she crumpled down upon the sill and thrust
one foot and leg through the aperture. With a long shudder
she closed her eyes and cautiously lowered the other leg.</p>

<p class='c008'>For an endless moment she sat suspended between heaven
and earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>There came a feeble tug at her skirt from behind, a plaintive
cry. And Claire’s swooning senses were aware of interruption.
With a flash of lucidity she realized that Bébé had
awakened and was trying in dumb fashion to attract her
attention. A new fear seized her. Suppose the little dog
were to see her fall and jump out after her? She leaned
back into the room perilously, and tried to push him from
her. But as if he realized her purpose, he only whined more
loudly and crawling up her skirts, crept around into her lap.
Claire found herself gazing into the eyes of the only being
who had ever loved her. Horror in her heart, she clutched
the little creature to her breast. For a nightmare moment,
they rocked on the rim of annihilation. Then with a groan
of relinquishment, she fell back into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as her trembling limbs would permit, she crawled
back on to the bed and lay sleepless until morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the sun, although brilliant and mocking, brought
counsel.</p>

<p class='c008'>She arose and tidied herself. It was not a long process,
as she had gone to bed fully dressed. Ringing for Ito, she
ordered coffee and a taxi. Then in the face of his obvious
disapproval, she gulped down a few swallows, ate a roll, and
patting Bébé lingeringly, left the apartment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />THE LOST GIRL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Cold rain fell in leaden streaks. Clouds, black and wind-swollen,
encircled the mountain-top. A ferocious wind
shrieked and whistled about the lodge like an unleashed
demon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crouched over the fire, Alexis gazed at Anne. Relaxed,
slim, on the chaise-longue by the hearth, she was looking into
the flames with an inscrutable expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis stirred uneasily.</p>

<p class='c008'>What was she thinking of, behind those drooping lids?
What inimical thought stirred beneath those silken coils
which shone like burnished metal in the firelight? He sighed.
Was she criticizing him for the way in which he had
parted from Claire the day before yesterday? She doubtless
considered him a blackguard. And was he very far removed
from one, after all? Emphatically no! And yet things like
this happened every day. Other men were being separated
from wives whom they had once professed to cherish. Surely,
there was more excuse for him? His own case was so different,
he who had been practically tricked into matrimony?</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet, ever since yesterday constraint had fallen between
him and this woman, whose personality obsessed him. Constraint,
of which they had never been conscious in those first
feverish days of illness. It must be that Anne had become
suddenly antagonistic towards him. At any rate, it was plainly
to be seen that he had outstayed his welcome, that she no
longer desired his presence. He must go away immediately,
to-morrow, perhaps. But where? Certainly not to the cabin.
A refuge at first, it had soon become a prison of maddened
and inarticulate fears. To return would be unthinkable. Yet
to go back to civilization would be almost equally difficult.
He was so tired, so unutterably soul-weary that the very idea
of having to meet people and cope with their curiosity turned
him cold. He shivered and drew his breath with a hissing
sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter, Alexis?” Anne’s tones fell upon the
silence like the ringing of a bell.</p>

<p class='c008'>He started uncontrollably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did you say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him pityingly. His egotistical young misery
at once touched and annoyed her. To-night she was a little
weary, a trifle bored with both him and the situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I merely asked what was the matter,” she repeated gently
enough. “A silly question, as it is self-evident. You have
been miserable ever since yesterday. I think you regret the
parting from your wife more than you realize. It has
made me very unhappy, too. I hope you were not harsh,
and that you said nothing final. Please forgive me for
interfering!” She smiled apologetically into his glum face
and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bridging the distance in one stride, he bent over the proffered
hand and kissed it with an intensity that took Anne
off her guard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As if you could ever interfere!” he exclaimed forcibly.
“You are an angel for bearing with me and my boorish
moods! It is a debt I never can repay,” he concluded rather
formally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense,” Anne laughed with less constraint. “I have
done nothing. But if you insist upon an eye for an eye and
a tooth for a tooth, you can repay me by doing nothing
rash just at present. You see I worry about you terribly, don’t
I?” She smiled up at him with disengaging frankness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are so good, so wise.” He sat down upon the floor
at her feet. “I am not worth all your trouble.” He tried unsuccessfully
to regain possession of her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed you are,” she interposed, “and even if you were
not, your art is!” she added significantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>His eyes, which had been fixed worshippingly on her face,
hardened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My art! And I flattered myself that you took a personal
interest in me. You’re just like the others, after all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rose angrily, and began to pace up and down the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both hurt and amused, she watched him with an indulgent
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is naturally the artist in you which interests me the
most,” she replied quietly. “Anything further would be an
impertinence,” she finished rather cruelly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The furious pacing stopped. He glared down upon her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you are impertinent!” he cried brutally. “For
unless you are a consummate actress, you are beginning to
care for me, me personally, more than for any fiddling I ever
have or am ever likely to do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A marble goddess looked suddenly forth from Anne’s stony
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you were not ill, and only a boy, I would send you
away for saying that!” Her voice was metallic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The icy tones congealed his blood. In an excess of remorse,
he fell down at her feet and hid his face on the chaise-longue.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forgive me,” he muttered. “But if you only knew how
much it means to have someone take an interest in me outside
of my music! To feel that I myself mean something to
someone! My music has always been first with everyone. I
have been like a rich man’s son, who is afraid to believe
that anyone cares for anything except his millions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Raising his face, he looked pleadingly into her eyes. His
misery melted her heart, but her tone remained cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you are forgetting your wife,” she said quietly.
“Surely you cannot believe that your music came first with
her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He evaded her reproachful gaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Claire, yes she did care!” His voice was at once
reassured and remorseful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne smiled down upon him ironically. The colossal
egotism of these geniuses! But her voice was unruffled as she
proceeded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does care, you mean! Alexis, look at me.” She sat up
and took his reluctant face into her hands. “I want you to
go back to Claire. I want you to make up to her for all your
past unkindness. Will you do it to please me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He jerked his head away violently and rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, ten thousand times no,” he cried. “Does a prisoner
ever return to his dungeon? How can you ask such a thing?
It is only because you are tired of me. Want to get rid
of me. Well, I am going any time you say. This minute,
if you wish!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head with a low laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, in all this rain?” she asked, as a sudden gust of
wind tore at the windows. “You are so excitable, my poor
Alexis! Come, you know I don’t want you to go. I shall
miss you sadly. But I can’t help thinking how much happier
you might be if you only would.” She looked wistfully into
the angry face.</p>

<p class='c008'>He returned her glance with scorn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Happier? There’s no such thing as happiness. At least
for me; I’m not so exacting as to demand it! But at least
I can be free, and I shall!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is nothing to prevent you, poor Alexis,” she
replied gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hung his head and the light suddenly went out of
his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are offended with me? I don’t blame you——” his
voice was low and broken. “I suppose this is good-bye?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A new pain bit into Anne’s heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, Alexis, no! How can you say so?” she broke in
contritely. “If you don’t feel you can go back to the others”—she
hesitated uncertainly for a moment, “you may remain
here with me. I have taken the lodge until the first of
November. There still remain almost ten days. Do you think
you could bear it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him less frankly. Her flush and the new
uncertainty of her voice enraptured Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, Anne,” he cried impetuously, calling her by her
name for the first time. “Why, being with you is the only
happiness I have ever had! It was the terrible fear of losing it
that has upset me so tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His face was radiant. In another moment, Anne feared
he might become demonstrative. With a slight flutter of
regret and excitement, she rose and ran to the piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I insist upon playing!” She ran her fingers over the keys
lightly, avoiding his tortured expression. “I’ve restrained
myself for ten days on your account, and now that it is
decided you are remaining, I refuse to go without my piano
any longer! Besides, I simply must drown out this wind if
I can. It is getting on my nerves!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Too astonished to remonstrate, slightly sick at his stomach,
Alexis fell into the nearest chair and steeled himself to listen.
From the corner of her eye, Anne admired his unexpected
control. Nothing in his polite attitude betrayed the nervous
torture she knew he was undergoing. But she chose to
ignore it.</p>

<p class='c008'>She broke into one of Chopin’s preludes and continued to
watch him furtively. His pallor turned a sickly gray. Small
beads of moisture stood out upon his forehead. The clenched
hands, the twisted lips, made Anne feel like an executioner.
But still she continued playing. And as she had hoped, the
ruse proved successful.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a few minutes, the nervous hands relaxed. A smile
loosened the tension of his lips. For a while he listened in
seeming content. Then evidently he could contain himself no
longer. Still pale, but no longer in agony, he was obviously
in the throes of a new and more vital emotion.</p>

<p class='c008'>With an awakened, exultant expression, he sprang out of
the chair and striding over behind her, swept her off the
piano stool and into the armchair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very good indeed!” he cried with unconscious condescension.
“But let me show you how it ought to be done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He gave the stool a professional twist or two, and sat
down and commenced to play. Slightly crestfallen, Anne
composed herself to listen.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took up the prelude where she had left off.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had not known that he had it in him. Acknowledged
master of the violin, he was a pianist of undoubted technique
and power as well. A month ago, such a performance from
a mere boy would have racked and humiliated, but now it was
sheer, unadulterated, pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t you tell me you could play the piano like
that?” she exclaimed almost peevishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wheeled about on the piano-stool and smiled at her
rather sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t,” he said simply. “It is merely a side issue, a
relaxation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne came and stood beside him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could slap you!” she retorted with mock anger. “The
idea of calling a talent like that a side issue! Why you could
make a career for yourself as a pianist if you wished.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed almost light-heartedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, you are making too much allowance for the
country piano. I’m afraid the small career I’ve had already
will have to last me the rest of my life!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne sighed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you want me to believe that you’ve forgotten how to
play the violin after this exhibition?” she asked crossly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He gave her a startled look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You think I’ve been trying to deceive you? You believe
that of me? Oh Anne!” he cried in anguished tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>She leaned over him remorsefully and patted the weary-looking
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Alexis,” she murmured. “I didn’t mean to hurt
you! Of course I know you wouldn’t deceive me intentionally.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He glanced up at her through grateful tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor useless Alexis,” he replied under his breath, “who
cumbers the earth with his wasteful presence. What are
you going to do with him?” His eyes held the plaintive
appeal of a lost child.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne moved away hastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Spank him and send him to bed,” she laughed, uneasy at
his tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden and more angry blast shook the house. Anne
went to the window and drew up the shade. She looked
out into the uproarious night. The rain beat against the
panes like waves washing over a porthole. Anne shivered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had almost forgotten the storm while you were playing,
hadn’t you? Come, see how weirdly the trees are behaving!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He strolled up behind her and they stood, looking out into
the blackness. Beaten beneath leaden shafts of rain, torn by
a diabolic wind, the placid forest had become an inferno of
twisting branches. Tossing limbs writhed in seeming agony
under each shrieking gust.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They look like a company of maddened demons,” Anne
shuddered and pulled down the shade. “I could almost believe
it is they and not the wind, which whistle and scream. It
reminds one of a witch’s Sabbath!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She went to the table, gathered up a book or two, and
prepared to go upstairs, when the brusque whirr of the telephone
stopped her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What can that be?” she cried completely startled. She
ran across the room and took down the receiver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, this is Mrs. Schuyler. Who is this? Oh—a telegram?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she waited for the message, she encountered Alexis’ eyes
with a startled inquiry in her own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is for you, Alexis,” she whispered. She held out the
receiver and moved aside. He backed away with nervous
horror.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please take the message for me, Anne!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded curtly and resumed her listening. A moment
passed before she spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I’m responsible,” she said shortly, evidently in
answer to some remonstrance from the other end. “You may
give me the message quite safely. I’ll write it down word
for word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out an imperious hand. Alexis rushed across the
room to the desk, secured pencil and paper and prepared to
write at her dictation. When she spoke her voice seemed
strangely flat and monotonous.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Claire missing since yesterday morning. Traced to St. Patrick’s
by Ito. Then clue lost. Fear worst. Return immediately.</p>

<div class='c015'>Your Mother”</div>

<p class='c012'>Anne replaced the receiver in silence and she and Alexis
looked into each other’s faces.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must go back at once,” she whispered finally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And leave you?” he exclaimed huskily. “Never! Besides
I don’t believe a word. It is merely a hoax, a clever trick
of my mother’s to get me back into her clutches. She’s quite
capable of it! But she can’t fool me so easily. I’ll not go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne met his wild young eyes with something akin to
horror.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, Alexis, you are deceiving yourself! This message
rings only too true, and I should never forgive myself
if I didn’t urge you to go, especially after what happened
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t know my mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She placed her hand upon his arm with an urgent gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis, you are behaving like a spoiled child! You
would never forgive yourself if something happened to
Claire because of you. The least you can do is to return
immediately. If it should turn out to be a hoax, which is
unbelievable, why you can come back again. Nobody can
force you to stay, you know!”</p>

<p class='c008'>At her appeal, a sudden sense of shame flooded him. He
nodded his head in bitter acquiescence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I suppose I must go,” he said slowly. “But how
can I leave you, how can I live without you?” His eyes
devoured her. She turned away to hide sudden tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, Alexis, you must not think of yourself now. Remember
poor Claire. Come, you must be brave.” Her voice
was gentle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You make me ashamed!” he cried. “But I love you so.
I don’t know what would become of me if I should have to
lose you, Anne!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised her hands to his lips and kissed them over and
over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Promise that you will not forsake me, that you will let
me remain your friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tears trembling on her lids, she looked down upon his
bent head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I promise,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a smothered cry he released her. He turned his
back abruptly and strode across the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What time does the early train leave?” he inquired huskily
from the doorway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At six, I believe,” responded Anne faintly. “Regina
will pack for you and of course Howard will drive you down
to the village,” she continued more firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His despairing eyes caught the regret in hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will let me hear from you?” his voice was full
of suppressed suffering.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” she replied. “Please telegraph if there is
any news. I’ll be going down myself in a few days probably.
It is becoming rather cheerless here now.” She cast
a nervous glance towards the windows against which the
rain continued to pound relentlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her unconcealed trouble kindled a light in Alexis’ eyes.
“She is beginning to love me,” he thought. A sense of fear
and joy permeated him, but he continued speaking calmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall say good-bye to-night, then, so as not to disturb
you so early in the morning. Good-bye, Anne—thank you.”
His voice broke. He turned and escaped up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pale, a little wistful, Anne watched the boyish figure disappear
around the landing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />MORTAL SIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Joy irradiating the small, wan features, Claire looked up
into Alexis’ face. At the pathetic bewilderment in her
eyes, a spasm of contrition shot through him. He sat down
beside the bed and took her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dim and bare, the hospital room was stereotyped but
comfortable. However, it struck a chill to Alexis’ heart and
he shuddered a little, as he returned the feeble pressure of
the cold fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Claire, what a horrible time you’ve had!” he
whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head and smiled up at him faintly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, Alexis, it might have been so much worse.
Everybody has been so good to me here. The sisters are
wonderful!” Her eyes left his face for a moment and travelled
to the window where a nun was sitting. The flaring
coif, the white kerchief, framed a beautiful serenity and
Claire sighed as her gaze rested upon the folded hands.
Would such peace ever be hers? she wondered enviously.
Alexis’ eyes, following hers, flashed sudden distaste. To him
the serenity spelt stupidity; the folded hands, laziness. Hatred
of all dogma had obsessed him since childhood, and was
still one of the few prejudices which had survived his habitual
indifference. It had always proved a bone of contention between
him and Claire, who during a three-year sojourn in a
French convent, had become an ardent, if somewhat spasmodic,
convert.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swift as was the expression of antagonism, Claire perceived
it. She clasped his fingers nervously and sought to distract
his attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Alexis, how did you ever find me? You must think
I am crazy not to have asked you immediately!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He smiled down upon her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, I knew you would come to it eventually,” he
paused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, how did you?” she insisted. “You see I didn’t
really come to myself until yesterday, and early this morning
when I told them to notify Aunt, they said that my family
already knew where I was and had ordered me to be put in
a private room. I was in the ward before.” She looked at
him gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis regarded her with pity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, poor little girl, I know. It must have been awful.
I never can forgive myself for all you’ve suffered.” He
stooped suddenly and kissed her on the cheek.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tears streaming down her face, she turned her head
away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t have to do that, Alexis,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>His lips salty with her tears, he continued somewhat unsteadily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you want to know how I found you, little cousin?
It was really very simple although long drawn out. Ito
watched you from the window as you left the house. He
saw you enter a taxi. (Something odd in your appearance
and manner had frightened him. Let me see, that was three
days ago, wasn’t it?)”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded mutely, and he continued.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When you didn’t arrive home that night, he called up the
taxi company and they traced you to the church door. Knowing
your religious proclivities,” they smiled tremulously at
each other, “I interviewed several of the priests and finally
found the one to whom you had confessed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That must have been horrible!” Claire interrupted with
forced levity. A growing fear was in her eyes. “What did
he tell you?” She sat up in bed. A deep flush suddenly
replaced her former pallor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her agonized embarrassment did not escape Alexis. He
broke in quickly, “Nothing at all, of course. Secrecy of the
confessional and all that, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She collapsed upon the pillows. Disregarding her obvious
agitation, Alexis went on quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He merely told me that you seemed ill. That perhaps
you had fainted in the street and been taken to some hospital.
I thought it an excellent suggestion, and after calling up
about four or five hospitals and describing you and your
clothes (you can thank Ito for that—he knew what you
had on to the last detail), we finally succeeded in discovering
you here. That is all.” Releasing her hand, which he had
held in his all this time, he patted it gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked up into his face with grateful eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh Alexis, how good of you to take so much trouble
for me. How can I ever thank you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wasn’t good of me, and you know it. I’ve been a
brute all along. But if you want to please me you must take
care of yourself. As soon as you are able to leave the hospital
and go back to the apartment you must take one of these
sisters home with you and keep her as long as necessary. But
I will consult the doctor about that,” he added with a business-like
air, which contrasted oddly with his usual lack of responsibility.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire sat up suddenly and clasped his arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That won’t be necessary at all. Please don’t consult
the doctor about me. I’m perfectly well, only a little tired
and not quite myself since——since you went to the sanitarium.
Now that you are all right, I shall pick up quickly and—and
Alexis,” she continued bravely, “whenever you want
the separation you can have it, of course!” She spoke in a
low voice so that the nun might not hear.</p>

<p class='c008'>He flushed painfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We won’t think about that now, Claire. I want you to
get well before we decide upon anything. Who knows, we
may change our minds?” he added with a weak desire to
please her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She winced. When she replied her voice was still low, but
almost hard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please don’t try to deceive me, Alexis. I know you too
well. You are sorry for me now. But you don’t love
me any more than you did a week ago. I am willing to
go back to your mother if you desire it. You are my husband
and I must obey you. But I beg of you not to pretend—that
is more than I can bear!” With a stifled sob she fell
back upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Torn with shame and pity, Alexis started to speak, but
before he could say a word, the sister rose from her seat
in the window and approached the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid you are exciting my patient,” she said pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis met her gentle gaze with a guilty expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid I am, but I didn’t mean to,” he stammered
contritely. “Perhaps I’d better go?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sister nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would be best, but I’ll give you a minute or two to
say goodbye in,” she added with a lenient smile. The young
couple interested her, and her old maid’s heart was gripped
by their very evident problem. With punctilious courtesy, she
turned and walked back to the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis knelt quickly beside the bed and laid his face
against Claire’s head. His lips upon the thick, black hair, he
whispered in the averted ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you ever forgive me, Claire? I must have been
born an utter cad. I just can’t seem to help it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned her face towards him indignantly and put her
hand upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t say such a thing,” she murmured beneath her
breath, but with startling intensity. “You are Alexis, and
that is all I ask. And now go, my dear, I am tired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She pushed him away feebly. He rose to his feet and
kissed remorsefully the little hand she extended.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not fit to live!” he exclaimed, unconsciously expounding
man’s most stereotyped phrase, and filling her
woman’s soul thereby with the usual illogical pity.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he had left and the nun had gone to her supper,
she broke down completely. Poor Alexis, poor Claire, she
thought bitterly, into what a miserable tangle they had blundered.
And what a wretched fool she herself had been.
Such a beautiful bond had existed between them, and in her
greedy effort to draw it still closer, she had snapped it asunder.
For her aunt, the real instigator of it all, she had scarcely
a thought of blame. Even if she had known the entire
truth, she probably would not have reproached her. Her
instinct told her that it was her own blissful acquiescence
by which she had been betrayed. She accepted her responsibility
very simply and without thought of contradiction.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was with this idea uppermost in her mind that she had
gone to St. Patrick’s, instead of her own little chapel, in
the hope of finding a priest to whom she would not have
to reveal her identity. It had been easy enough to find him
and to recount her simple tragedy as briefly as possible. But
the verdict had not been the one for which she had hoped,
although the adviser had proved more gentle and more
wise than the average haphazard priest upon whom she and
her problem might have fallen. And she had kept nothing
back, from the casual nature of the marriage itself, to the
unforeseen but natural and physical consequences buried
deep within her body. Even when she came to the pitiful
attempt at suicide she had drawn forth scarcely a reproach
from the other side of the confessional. The old man
had listened to similar stories so often. His heart had
been bruised by a thousand vicarious sorrows. It was not
until she hinted at her desire for escape that he raised a
protest. She had whispered brokenly of Alexis’ love for another
woman and had ventured to ask if it wouldn’t be possible
for the church to grant a divorce, or even to annul the
marriage. The old man had told her very sternly that that
would be a sin almost as mortal as suicide, in the face of the
life which she was carrying. Did she want to add another
fatherless waif to the unnamed legions already encumbering
the world? Her duty was to the new life, to make its inception
as happy as possible, and through it to bring her mistaken
young husband back into the pathway of duty. At those
last words, Claire recalled that she had almost smiled. Alexis
and the pathway of duty had seemed so ludicruously unakin,
somehow! No, the only thing to do, the priest had continued
somewhat droningly, was to take up her life again as she had
left it. If her husband did not wish to live with her, that
was not her fault. Probably when the child was born, he
would have a change of heart, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only partly convinced, but too weary to resist the age-old
arguments, she had left the confessional with a half-formulated
resolve of drifting for a while and seeing whether
time might not alter the situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But out on the church steps the brilliant sunshine seemed to
pierce into her brain. She had been seized with familiar
giddiness. A merciful veil of blackness suddenly obscured
her vision, and she knew no more until yesterday afternoon
when she had awakened to find herself in a hospital ward.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had been a rather horrifying sensation to lose an entire
day and night out of existence. To suddenly discover oneself
in the public ward of a great hospital! A horror mitigated
by the kindness of the sisters and the concern of the
visiting young doctor, who had taken it for granted that
Claire had realized the exact nature of her condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since then, before seeing Alexis, she had had time to think.
She had lain awake all night over her problem. In spite of
the frightful wrench to spirit and pride, she had come to
the same inevitable conclusion as the day before. Because
of the child that was coming she would sacrifice her own
desires and return to Alexis’ mother. However, she allowed
herself one reservation, of which she knew the old priest
would not approve, but to which pride obstinately clung.
Neither Alexis nor his mother should be told of her “hopes”
as the sister so chastely put it, until it was no longer possible
to conceal it from anyone. As soon as she heard that Alexis
was coming to the hospital, she had made both the doctor and
the nurse promise solemnly not to divulge her secret. A request
acceded to with small reluctance, as similar whims constantly
arose within their province.</p>

<p class='c008'>How devoutly she hoped they were keeping their word!</p>

<p class='c008'>For probably at this very moment Alexis was interviewing
the doctor on her behalf and making arrangements for the
return to the apartment. That return which she dreaded from
the bottom of her soul. That apartment where her aunt,
Mme. Petrovskey held sway and was waiting to encompass
her with the cold and bland silence which was hers habitually,
and which, characteristically, she had not broken since Claire’s
disappearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had not dared to ask Alexis if he would be there, too.
She hardly knew whether she desired it. An appalling weariness
warned her that she would be unable to cope with the
emotions his presence involved. Yet without him life was
void, the future a terrifying blank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Too spent for tears, she turned her leaden body and
burying her face against the pillow, sank into a lethargy as
deep and almost as peaceful as the elusive death which had
failed her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />YOUTH’S TEMPEST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Anne looked up into the Marchese’s face with a quizzical
smile. Beneath the staccato uproar of piano and laughter
his voice flowed liquid and unbroken. Interesting and
even thrilling as were his recent adventures, somehow his account
lacked the usual fire. It was difficult to focus her
attention. The fervid charm of their intercourse seemed to
have vanished. Anne’s smile stiffened upon her lips. Her eyes
wandered rather vaguely about the crowded room.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the usual <i>olla podrida</i> of mixed professions and
nationalities that had gathered in her drawing room for the
last four or five years. One or two genuine artists and
musicians, a writer of indubitable distinction, an actress of
greater renown than ability, several clever pretenders, and the
man at her side, whose fame as an archæologist, stood undisputed,
and whose dignity and charm were a byword on two
continents. A man whose friendship had gratified her for
years and whose attentions had more than satisfied a fastidious
and pampered vanity.</p>

<p class='c008'>But somehow, he failed to thrill her to-night. His virile
and rather grave personality was overshadowed by one weaker,
yet more compelling. Between her and the dark, high-bred
face, intruded a pale, sensitive silhouette; the memory of
burning, youthful words. Not accustomed to float upon the
tide of emotions, Anne was conscious of a bewildered self-contempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a determined effort she shepherded her truant thoughts
and turned to the Marchese just as the boy at the piano had
banged the last smashing cord of a Sowerby Medley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rather relentless, wasn’t it?” she laughed above the
raucous applause.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blasphemy, pure and simple,” shuddered the Marchese.
“Like a visit to the dentist. The buzzer, you know?” He
rolled his r’s and waved a graphic hand. “It sets my teeth
on edge completely. How can you bear it, <i>carissima</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s rather amusing, don’t you think? Poor Vittorio, are
you so old-fashioned as to enjoy a perpetual <i>Celeste Aïda</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, thank God,” he exclaimed fervently. “Do you suppose
Orpheus would ever have rescued his Eurydice by playing
jazz? No, no, the old guardian beasts were too artistic
for that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She waved her fan gaily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But nowadays we don’t even believe in Hades!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, but it is always Paradise when with you, <i>Cara</i> Anna,”
he murmured somewhat bromidically.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked up into his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are always so good, Vittorio! I—I’m afraid I don’t
deserve it.” She paled a little beneath the earnest gaze of
the red-brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed indulgently beneath his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How is that, don’t deserve it? But what has entered
into you, dear lady, since your return from the mountain?
Have you met a god that you are so uncharacteristically humble?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Failing to meet her eyes, his own became suddenly troubled.
Had Anne perhaps indeed received the <i>coup de foudre</i>
which he had been dreading all these years?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do fallen gods dwell upon the mountain-tops?” There
was a trace of uncertainty in Anne’s smile. Her eyes grew
misty as the pale obsessive silhouette rose once more between
them. “And if I had?” she challenged.</p>

<p class='c008'>His lids veiled sudden apprehension.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Met a fallen god?” he inquired lightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded, meeting his searching gaze with an innocent
stare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then, unconquered lady, beware!” he shook a solemn
finger, not at all reassured by the innocent stare. Experience
had taught him that even the best of women lie when occasion
demands it. “The fallen god is the most dangerous
of all. His halo may be crooked, but it dazzles. His poor,
stumbling feet of clay inspire that pity which poets claim
is akin to love.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He finished with a mock heroic flourish. They both
laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be niggards. Share the joke,” came a husky drawl
from behind them, as the long, but prodigious, Ellen Barnes
sank into the nearest chair. An actress of the foremost
rank, of greater personal than artistic appeal, her ample
shoulders had assumed the regal mantle of Broadway. Her
reign undisputed, her manner was more royal than the
queen’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchese smiled upon the intruder suavely. He
thought her acting execrable, and knew she would be hissed
off any worth-while French or Italian stage, but her regular,
well-nourished beauty was reposeful, her languid air tickled
his humor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Marchese was discussing feet,” said Anne slyly,
rather relieved at the interruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other woman stared incredulously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Feet? Metrical or unpoetic like mine?” she threw out a
large, but shapely foot, and regarded it with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ellen, your vanity is incorrigible!” laughed Anne lightly
as she rose. “But if you promise to be a good girl and
not corrupt the Marchese I’ll trust you alone with him for
a while. They are waving to me from the piano.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchese surveyed her retreat with a whimsical
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am very much frightened,” he said, turning towards the
delighted Ellen, who sprawled largely nonchalant upon her
cushions. “Was it not Hedda Gabler to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh yes, a revival,” exclaimed Ellen eagerly. “Do you
think the part suits me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchese’s reply was more than satisfactory. But
his eyes followed the figure of the other woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her apple green dress, clinging closely about her, Anne
was crossing the room. They will want me to dance, I
suppose, she thought, looking about her with dissatisfaction.
She felt suddenly un-at-home, almost ill at ease. The familiar
surroundings still appealed with the claim of long association.
The <i>tempera</i> walls still soothed, the carved Florentine
furniture had lost no dignity, but somehow tonight the
carefully chosen austerity rang false. Or was it merely that
she was bored? Yes, bored almost to tears by the deafening
prattle of the puppets she had gathered together? Yes, that
was it. Why had she never sensed their incongruity so
strongly before?</p>

<p class='c008'>She approached the multi-colored group at the piano and
looked down into the face of the boy seated at the keyboard.
Brilliant, degenerate, his playing just escaped the professional.
As he returned her gaze, something wistful and defiant within
the tired eyes suddenly struck at Anne’s heart. Something
that seemed to cry: “there is a devil within me, but I did not
put him there. Besides, who cares?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne leaned over him. Her emerald earrings tinkled gaily
in his face. A faint perfume swept his façile senses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How goes it, Gerald?” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, life’s a dirge, as usual.” A smile painted upon the
wistfulness, he flung back his head and with distended nostrils
seemed to inhale her into his consciousness. Then springing
up, he held out his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us drown sorrow in a dance,” he begged. Pushing
a rather naked and wild-eyed young woman into his seat he
commanded her to play. “A waltz, anything so long as it is
immediate!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a toss of the bobbed-head and a mechanical grab at
a recalcitrant shoulder-strap, the girl broke into a grotesque
<i>cancan</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rather wearily, Anne permitted herself to be swept into
Gerald’s arms. Joined by six or seven other couples they
wheeled around the room, like a flock of gaily-feathered pigeons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne felt herself studied by the weary young eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter?” she said a little peevishly. “Have
you discovered a wrinkle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy pressed her to him with spasmodic strength. She
marvelled at the force of the doll-like creature, and at herself
for ever having been, even momentarily, swayed by his puerile
passion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be foolish, Gerald,” she added crossly, as he continued
to crush her against him. The music stopped with a
staccato crash. They circled to a finish near the alcove where
Ellen Barnes and the Marchese were bolstering a dwindling
conversation by forced inanities.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne accepted the Marchese’s chair with gratitude. Vittorio
was a real man and a relief after the hectic Gerald.
She looked up at the latter with a rather tired smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do get yourself a drink, Gerald, you look so hot. Thompson
is serving them in the library, I believe. You may bring
me one, too, if you like,” she added to mitigate the rather
abrupt dismissal. Personally, she loathed cocktails.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen was looking almost animated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Marchese has been showing me a chain he dug up
somewhere in Persia,” she drawled between puffs of a scented
cigarette. “He tells me I may wear it in my next play, which
is taken from the Arabian nights or the Bible, I never can
remember exactly which. At any rate, it’s antique and oriental!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held the chain up for Anne’s approval. It was of hammered
gold, studded at intervals with monstrous uncut turquoise.
A flush rising in her pale face, Anne fingered it lovingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How unbelievably beautiful,” she murmured, almost reproachfully.
What could have come over Vittorio? He did
not usually juggle his treasures promiscuously. Could he
have become infatuated with Ellen? “I’m sure it must have
a story. Do tell it to us, Vittorio.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He met her uncertain smile with concealed amusement.
How could he tell her how openly the woman had angled for
the bauble?</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s rather a long story, I’m afraid,” he commenced with
his usual amiability. “However, if you command——-”</p>

<p class='c008'>But at this moment Gerald appeared with a small tray of
cocktails and as they helped themselves the doorbell pealed
shrilly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A glass raised halfway to her lips, Anne paused almost imperceptibly,
while the butler strode solemnly down the hall,
and opening the street door, indulged in a prolonged but discreet
parley.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gerald noted Anne’s abstraction with malicious curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is any of the gang missing?” he said. “Shall I go and
see who it is, Anne?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Anne had risen. With a disconcerting little smile she
swept by him; as he started to follow she looked back over
her shoulder and laughed softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you can’t come with me, Gerald. You mustn’t be
so curious! Perhaps I have a mystery in my life, who knows?
At any rate, I promise to call for help if it’s a burglar!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she swept out of the arched doorway, the boy looked
after her in chagrined anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heart knocking against her side, she emerged into the high
narrow hall. Thompson was at the door, and as she had surmised,
the tall stranger with whom he was discreetly parleying
was Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Muffled in a great coat, a soft hat pulled over his eyes, he
presented the appearance of a conspirator in the movies, and
Anne did not wonder that Thompson had hesitated to permit
him to enter. Suppressing a hysterical desire to laugh, she
interposed herself between the two men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s quite all right, Thompson,” she said in a low voice,
“you may go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the surprised man disappeared down the corridor, she
held out her hands to Alexis. He seized and covered them
with kisses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be careful.” A pulse hammering faintly in her throat,
she drew him swiftly into the house. “The house is full of
people and someone may come out here at any moment!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He cast a hunted look about him. A sudden shriek of
laughter rose shrilly above the rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t there any place where we can be undisturbed?” His
lowering gaze rested upon her angrily. But it was the first
time he had seen her in evening dress and as her beauty
penetrated through his irritation, his expression melted suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are like an alabaster lamp!” he exclaimed. “Your
skin is luminous, as if a light were glowing from within. I
think you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She gave a husky little laugh and catching hold of his
hand, pulled him after her up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will go to my sitting-room, which Thompson insists
upon calling the ‘budwar,’ and Regina the <i>salotino</i>,” she
whispered gaily.</p>

<p class='c008'>She led the way up the curved, stone, stairway. He followed
submissively, an absent eye upon the tapestries that
covered the stone walls. They entered the sitting-room at the
top of the stairs and Anne closed the door firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Enfin seuls!</i>” she exclaimed sinking with a comic little
air into a chair before the fire. Throwing aside his hat and
coat, Alexis glowered somberly down upon her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a week since we parted, and I’ve been starving for
the sight of you,” he cried with a catch in his voice. “Why
didn’t you let me know that you had returned?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His agitated face reproached her. She laughed rather
nervously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only arrived yesterday afternoon, impatient one. Besides,
I had received your telegram and knew that everything
was all right. I was going to call you up to-morrow morning.
But now I shan’t have to, shall I?” She drew herself
up briskly. “Come, don’t stand there glowering at me. Sit
down, tell me your news.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wounded at her sudden change of tone, Alexis sank upon a
stool at her feet. Putting his arms about his knees, he stared
gloomily into the flames. “What do you want to know?” he
inquired sullenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne repressed an impatient sigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me about Claire,” she said quietly. “Will she be
able to leave the hospital soon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She seems to be perfectly all right, now, and expects to
return home in a few days,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne leaned forward tensely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall you be there, Alexis?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked up into her face with utter surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I? Of course not. I’ve already taken an apartment on
Gramercy Park, and shall probably go away as soon as my
affairs are settled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you thinking of going?” she murmured conversationally.</p>

<p class='c008'>At her indifferent tone, he shrugged nonchalantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anywhere, nowhere! The South Sea Islands—Russia,
perhaps!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne nodded again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little touch of Bolshevism would be akin at present,”
she commented drily.</p>

<p class='c008'>He crimsoned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You think I’m impossible, don’t you, Anne?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Encountering his angry, pleading gaze, she laughed uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you make life impossible for yourself—and
others!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He wheeled about and faced the fire with tragic, sullen
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are right. I’m a curse to myself and everyone else.
The sooner I am out of it the better for all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A tug of pain at her heart, Anne leaned forward and laid
her hand upon his thick, blonde hair. “My dear, my poor
dear,” her voice was compassionate and caressing.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a guttural cry, Alexis turned, and flinging himself
at Anne’s feet, buried his face in her lap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t hate me! If you do, I shall kill myself. Say
you won’t hate me. Say it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tears welled up into Anne’s eyes. Taking his face in her
hands, she raised it to her own. “My poor Alexis, my poor
boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you are crying, you love me!” he exclaimed naïvely.</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head. A faint smile traversed her quivering
lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know. I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Seizing her hands, he showered kisses into the upturned
palms. “Anne, Anne, I love you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The tremulous smile still lifting her lips, she pushed him
from her, and rose to her feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Alexis, this won’t do. We must pull ourselves together,
or you will have to go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He faced her incredulously, as she leaned, pale and enigmatic,
against the mantel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You wouldn’t send me away now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You would ruin our lives for the sake of a convention?”
He strode towards her menacingly. But his melodramatic
manner had stirred her dormant cynicism. She laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Alexis, don’t take it so seriously. We would be
utterly miserable together. You know it. Come, let us be
content to be friends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out her hand, but he backed away angrily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are heartless—cruel.” He threw himself down
upon the small divan before the fire, flinging his head back
amongst the cushions. “You know that you are the only
thing in the world that makes life worth living for me, and
yet you deny yourself to me, just because you are afraid of
what people will say. Of what that cackling crowd of
snickerers downstairs might think of you. I thought you
were bigger than that, Anne.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked down into the wrathful face with recovered
self-possession.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That crowd of snickerers, as you so politely call them,
means very little in my life. But my own self-respect happens
to mean a great deal. If you expect me to become your
mistress just because you appeal to my compassion, you are
doomed to disappointment! If my friendship will content
you, that is another thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her coldness fell upon him like a revivifying shower. The
apathetic young figure sprang from the divan with a bound.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What an ass I’ve made of myself! Just because you were
kind, I was fool enough to imagine you loved me. I suppose
it didn’t seem possible that I could feel about you the
way I do without any return from you. I—I think I’d better
go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, Alexis, you don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He ignored her imploring gesture, and taking up his hat
and coat, started for the door. But it was too late.</p>

<p class='c008'>A languid footfall fell outside in the corridor. Before
Anne could reach the door, it opened to admit Ellen Barnes,
a rising wave of voices mounting in her wake.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a swift movement, Anne sprang forward and closed
the door behind the other woman. Standing with her back
against it, she looked at Ellen with a mixture of command
and appeal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you think I was never coming?” she asked. “Do
go downstairs again and tell the others I’ll be there directly.
I’ll explain later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a keen glance into Alexis’ face, a lazy smile upon
her lips, Ellen lounged into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you introduce us first? Don’t worry, I won’t give
you away!” she purred. She sat down, prepared to light a
cigarette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne concealed her anger beneath a casual smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s nothing to give away, as you call it, Ellen. This
gentleman is calling upon me on private matters. If you will
excuse us, I’ll come down as soon as he has finished telling
me what he came to say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen rose, a quizzical gleam in her eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sorry to have interrupted a business conference,” she
waved her unlighted cigarette languidly. “Since when has
Mr. Petrovskey given up music for stocks and bonds? Mr.
Petrovskey, won’t you please become my adviser, too?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned towards Alexis, good-natured mockery in her
large, infantile gaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stepped forward with a rueful laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid I’m not qualified. You see, poor Mrs. Schuyler
was only trying to shield me. Since—since my illness,”
he choked a little and then continued swiftly, “it has been
very difficult for me to meet people, and so she was kind
enough to bring me up here. I—I didn’t know she was receiving
tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen’s eyes softened. Her façile sympathy was touched by
the haggard young face, the pitiful and manly attempt at
explanation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand perfectly, and I’m sorry I blundered in upon
you like the great cow in a China shop that I am. But now
that I’m here, won’t you let me say that I hope you’ll soon
be better, and giving us some more of your wonderful music.
I’ve heard you so many times, and of course I couldn’t help
recognizing you the minute I saw your face.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Going to the door, she put her hand on the knob. “I guess
I’ll be going now. Stay as long as you like, Anne. I’ll tell
them you’re dead, or have acquired a sick headache from the
Bacardi.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne moved forward swiftly and joined her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, don’t make things out quite so black as that.
I’ll come with you. And we’ll see if we can’t get rid of
them. It is almost two o’clock and they ought to be leaving
any minute? Then, we can return and visit with Mr.
Petrovskey again. How about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great!” said Ellen. “I want to know just how you met
‘an’ everythin’,’ as Briggs says.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne looked back at Alexis pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you wait for us? I’m sure we shan’t be long. Just
make yourself comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, I shall be all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He bowed stiffly as they left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment his hatred of the world almost included
Anne. Did she think he was going to remain placidly by
while she and this handsome, hulking, creature discussed his
affairs? No, that was too much to ask him as yet. He must
get out of here at once. When Anne did not find him she
would understand. Yes, he must leave at once. But how?
The front stairs were impossible, judging from the voices and
laughter below. To sneak down the back way like a thief,
even if he knew the way, would be utterly detestable. But
what else could he do? Snatching up hat and coat, he once
more muffled himself to unrecognition and was starting for
the door when his eye fell upon the bell-rope. The idea of
summoning Thompson to show him out the back way proved
a comfortable compromise to his ruffled dignity. He pulled
at the pretty tasseled vanity, and awaited the outcome with
inward trepidation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was Regina, not Thompson, who answered the
summons.</p>

<p class='c008'>At sight of the muffled figure the old woman nearly
screamed. But before she could utter a sound Alexis seized
her by the arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you know me, Regina?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The <i>signorino</i> Alexis!” exclaimed the old woman softly.
“Does the <i>signora</i> know?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis nodded. “I have just seen her, Regina, it’s all
right. She has gone downstairs again. And now I must go.
Will you—will you please show me the back stairs and help
me to get out without being seen? You,—you know——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Distressed at his confusion, the old woman broke in eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Si, si, Signorino,</i> of course I understand. The <i>signorino</i>
is not well, he does not wish to see a lot of strangers! If he
will follow me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Running lightly down the corridor, she preceded him to a
green baize door and held it open while he passed within. Ill
at ease, raw from the recent encounter, he followed her down
the back stairs and out to the side entrance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope the <i>signorino</i> is better?” queried Regina, as he
passed by her into the areaway. “Shall he be making the
music again soon?” she added eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>As her meaning penetrated his misery, Alexis started, as if
she had inadvertently touched some spiritual reflex. With a
muttered excuse he strode out on to the sidewalk in front of
the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>The air had suddenly become raw and damp, and a blustering
wind raged down the narrow street, tearing away in
its passage the few last leaves from the small, sickly trees.
Rain had commenced to fall in large, scattered drops.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis shivered. He cast a reluctant look up at the luminous
windows of the house. Voices and laughter floated out into
the empty street. Shadows flitted and mingled, behind the
opaque shades. He lingered uncertainly for a moment, the
prey of undefinable desires.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly an excess of hilarity burst from the open door and
the figure of a man and woman emerged on to the sidewalk.
They passed Alexis and he instinctively crouched against the
shadow of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne is becoming secretive in her dangerous thirties,” the
woman was murmuring as they made their way towards a
motor brougham that stood waiting by the curb. “You’ll have
to be careful, Marchese. You know they say she’s had quite
a vampish past.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man laughed politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid I’m too old a friend to be frightened off as
easily as that, Miss Barnes. As Mrs. Schuyler knows, I am
one of those tiresome fellows who never listens to scandal. It
has been a pleasant evening, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man deposited the discomfited lady within the
brougham and watched the car drive off. Then, turning
on his heel, he reëntered the house. Before the door closed
behind him Alexis heard Anne’s voice plaintively playful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was she maligning me, Vittorio?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the man’s answer, caressing, muffled, was lost within
the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shivering and dazed, Alexis pulled his collar up about his
throat. Lowering his head against the rain, in a bull-like,
butting gesture, he strode toward Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p class='c008'>What a fool he had been to imagine he could interest a
woman like Anne, an idolized doll, surrounded by male and
female sycophants, who probably took advantage of her wealth
and loneliness. A woman, whimsical as a pet kitten, who
had enjoyed him like a new toy for a while, but as soon as
he became hackneyed, would drop him as casually as she had
taken him up. Really, it would be too callow of him to
expect more! In her eyes he was only a thwarted musician
who had enjoyed a flashing, comet-like success, only to be
swallowed once more into the nethermost void. It was not
that he grudged her elegant and expensive surroundings. He
could not conceive of her in any other <i>milieu</i> (for instance,
how uncomfortable she would be in the gorgeous, ready-made,
apartment on 59th Street!) But it had all frightened him a
little. He had missed the leveling <i>camaraderie</i> of the mountain
lodge. The contrast had proved too glaring for his flimsy
nerves, and he had swaggered before her like a bully. What
must she think of him? What an ill-bred pup he must appear
in contrast with this Marchese, this stalwart, suave man of
the world who had known how to put a gossiping woman in
her place without loss of temper or dignity, who had hinted
of his friendship with Anne as of something too solid and
enduring to be shaken by trivialities. Who was this man?
What place did he occupy in Anne’s life? Was he an unacknowledged
lover, or a future husband? And what chance
had he, Alexis Petrovskey, the musical waif, against a man of
her own caste, who not only could give her the position suited
to her, but the honor which it is in the power of the poorest
to bestow? While he himself had actually had the temerity
to offer the ironic gift of a broken life and an illicit love.
The wonder was not that she had laughed at his egotistical
insanity, but that she had tempered her refusal with kindliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Invaded by a desolate humility, he strode out from the
ravine-like street on to the avenue. Disregarding a taxi which
like a benevolent but unwieldy carrier-pigeon would have
taken him safely home to Gramercy Square, he hurried across
the wet and glistening pavement to where the park, naked,
shorn, welcomed him drearily. Entering one of the windswept
paths, he sank heavily on to a bench.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the end. He would not try to see Anne any
more. He refused to draw her down into the slough of his
misery again. He would finish up his affairs, settle a certain
sum upon his mother and Claire, as much as he could afford,
leaving only a meager allowance for his own future. Then
he would go abroad and drag out the bathos of his days in
some obscure corner of the old world, where his face and name
had not penetrated. And perhaps the end would not be long
in coming. For he had always felt that his would not be a
long life. For the candle to blow out before it had spluttered
to its ignominious finish, seemed suddenly both beautiful
and fitting. The thought soothed his whirling senses
like a promise of peace; a colossal lullaby from the infinite.
Enfolded within its majestic irony, he drifted into a reverie
in which all sense of time and space was lost. Chin sunk into
the clammy collar of his overcoat, he gazed before him into
the dripping branches of the trees. Gazed so long and
remained so motionless that he did not notice when the rain
ceased to fall. Nor observed that it had gradually solidified
into a jelly-like fog which coiled about the trees in sickly
wreaths.</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not even look up when a hulking shadow moved
between him and the enswathed world. It was not until a
mechanical “move along, move along, man, the park ain’t no
dormitory,” penetrated his dull senses, that he became aware
of his chilled and paralyzed body. Looking stupidly up into
the dim round face of the policeman, he broke into a short,
hysterical laugh, rose unsteadily to his feet and laughing and
coughing, wended his way down the wind-swept path in the
wake of the scattering leaves.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c009'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />MERRY-GO-ROUND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Confess it, Anne. You are bored unspeakably, is it not
so?” exclaimed the Marchese, as he poured a few drops
of Bacardi into a cup of tea, before handing it to Anne.
“As for me, who have only been in New York for two
weeks, I am a ruin! Not a reposeful ruin like those I am
digging up in Sicily, but rather like those of Pompeii, racked
by earthquake and volcanic eruptions. How can you stand it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne smiled indulgently. The Marchese’s symbolic hyperboles
always amused her. Nestling into her cushions, she
sipped her doctored tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am tired, Vittorio! But what else is there to do? One
has got to go through the gestures, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gestures? Contortions, you mean! The life you are
leading is about as restful, not to say dignified, as that of a
trapeze performer or an animal trainer. You will break
down if you don’t look out. And it doesn’t suit you, <i>carissima</i>,
this perpetual chasing. You were intended to be a
<i>grande dame</i>, a——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A Florentine Marchesa?” broke in Anne maliciously. “I
believe you would like to see me, old and settled with a flock
of <i>bambini</i> clustered about my gouty knees, and a mustache
bristling above my dewy lips!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Not at all crestfallen, the Marchese gazed merrily into
her stormy eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How we hate to be tied up!” he laughed. “And how
we loathe the idea of being respectable and dowagerly. The
<i>bambini</i>, of course, I couldn’t answer for, but as to the
mustache, there is always Zip!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wretch!” she laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The firelight played upon her pale features, as she returned
his gaze. A tea-gown of claret-colored velvet clung to her
relaxed body in suave folds, emphasizing the gardenia pallor
of throat and arms, the russet splendor of her hair. He gave
vent to his adoration.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you were not so slim, you’d make a gorgeous Titian
as you lie there, Anne. There’s something Sixteenth Century
and magnificent about you. A Bianca Cappello smiling over
the rim of a poisoned goblet. There’s nothing modern about
you, except your mode of life, which is as lurid and reposeful
as a cubist daub. Let’s see, what was to-day’s hectic
program?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne laughed and reached for a crumpet. “Dressmaker’s
this morning and hats. Lunch with Gerald and a matinée.
Inquisitorial tea at present. Later, dinner at the Ritz with
you and Ellen and that new Hindoo of hers, the theater again
and the new dance club. That’s all. A nice little merry-go-round,
warranted to keep on whirling forever, to the same
tenpenny tune. With no disconcerting progress whatsoever.
What more can you ask of life?” she added with a cynical
little laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>His compassionate eyes embarrassed her, but she shrugged
disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I admit I would have liked to do nothing to-night but
sit before the fire and read one of my memoirs. But
what can I do? The tickets were bought, the party arranged,
so I suppose I must sip the bitter dregs of anti-climax
philosophically.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so unfortunately must I,” he sighed resignedly. “But
the dance club, to watch you being ogled by an amorous
Hindoo! I shudder. Anne, Anne, when will you put an
end to my misery? Leave this, what do you call it, half-baked
existence. Come with me to Florence, to Sicily. Let
us lead a fuller life. A life of travel and repose, with a
horizon wide enough for study and meditation, and an occasional
oasis, if you desire, of theaters and dance clubs. Let
our friends be those who dare to think and to do, who have
learned to appreciate the exquisiteness of leisure, and not to
fritter it away. You Americans treat an idle hour as if it
were a horrible void that might engulf you if you didn’t diligently
fill it in with little nothings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Much amused, Anne lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A proposal and a sermon in one breath! Really, Vittorio,
you are certainly an original. You come all the way from
Italy to drag me back to your prehistoric caves and then preach
to me in a thoroughly mediæval and unprehistoric manner.
You spoil your own effects. I had almost made up my mind
to return to Florence before Christmas—but now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She rolled her eyes and gestured comically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be capricious, Anne darling. You know I’m no
preacher. And you would look adorable attired in white
linen knickerbockers, riding on the back of a donkey——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Supporting a heavy white umbrella with one hand, and
brushing off a horde of cannibalistic flies with the other—so
restful and inspiring!” Anne blew smoke rings into his eager,
dark face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are no flies in winter, and where I’ve been working
it is sometimes very cold. The white umbrella would be
entirely unnecessary. My villa is an antique dream of old-rose
marble and its terrace and garden seem to sweep right
out into the ardent blue of the sea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What about modern improvements?” inquired Anne flippantly.
But at his description her pupils had expanded, her
whole face had taken on a softer, more rested, expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is a bath,” he replied simply. “But of course no
electricity. Hanging lamps and an army of candles shed a
soft benediction over the old walls. I promise you, you will
be very comfortable. It is a foolish gardener who transplants
an exotic into the soil of unprotected fields.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He leaned forward earnestly. Her eyes cloudy with
feeling, she laid her hand upon his.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are so adorably literal, Vittorio. Such a boy in spite
of all your experience! Any woman who couldn’t trust herself
to go with you to the ends of the earth, would be a
blind fool.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you will make up your mind? You will come?”
he cried eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head with a maternal smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who knows, Vittorio? My emotions seem to be as unstable
as the weather. I’m about as reliable as a will-o’-the-wisp.
Better place your allegiance elsewhere, dear friend. I
have kept you waiting too long already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rose to his feet and stood over her vehemently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never, never. There’s no woman who can compare with
you, <i>bellissima donna</i>. And if there is, I do not want her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about the statuesque Ellen? One doesn’t shed
turquoise necklaces for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He blushed like a guilty school boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Were you jealous, Anne?” His eyes were uncontrollably
eager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps a little. If it would please you, Vittorio?” she
teased.</p>

<p class='c008'>He threw back his head, laughing ruefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is impossible to get the better of you. I retire defeated,
as usual.” He pointed with an expressive forefinger at the
clock. “I imagine Regina is fuming outside in the corridor,
waiting to slip some new magnificence upon you, to dazzle us
all with to-night. But she cannot improve upon perfection.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Indicating the claret velvet with a quick gesture, he bent
over her hand and kissed it lightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the door closed behind him, Anne’s smile faded. She
dropped back onto the chaise-longue and closed her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last ten days had been horrible. A kaleidoscopic nightmare
with about as much plot and sequence as a Broadway
revue. The only consoling factor being the large and sane
devotion of Vittorio. Gerald had made an amorous bore of
himself, and she had had to snub him. And Ellen, well it
had been too detestable of her to recognize Alexis at sight like
that. And her way of accepting Anne’s explanation, more
than irritating. Indulging in one or two lovers a year, she
was delighted to catch Anne in what she transparently considered
a similar frailty. It had been still more humiliating to
have to demand secrecy. But in order to protect Alexis, it had
been the only thing to do. And although Ellen’s good nature
was proverbial, so was her indiscretion. To expect her to keep
eternal silence upon her discovery of the return of Alexis
Petrovskey, over whom the entire musical world was agog,
would be demanding a stoical repression of which the woman
was incapable. It was only a question of time before Alexis’
secret would be common property. Meanwhile the only thing
to do was to keep Ellen in a good humor and watch her like a
hawk, which was more difficult than usual, as she was resting
between plays and insisted upon attending every show and
dance club in New York, until Anne’s nerves were frayed
and existence had become a monotonous nightmare of jazz
and naked shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the worst of it was that Anne had neither seen nor
heard from Alexis since he had disappeared from the house
on that ghastly night of his coming. She had returned to
her sitting room after the others had all gone, to find it empty
except for Regina, whose explanation of his hurried flight had
not proved very comforting. Evidently, he had been wounded
to the quick, not only by her coldness, but by the entire ignominious
situation. Her offer of a tepid friendship had driven
him away perhaps forever. Otherwise how could his continued
silence be accounted for? He had mistaken hesitation
for anger, ridicule as dismissal. Although he must have been
exposed for years, ever since adolescence, to that greedy feminine
horde who prey upon the matinée idol, he had remained
almost virginal. Even marriage had not destroyed a certain
quality of innocence, at once boyish and pathetic. A quality
which appealed to Anne’s disillusionment more strongly than
any amount of <i>savoir faire</i>. And she knew instinctively that
his love for her, although young as yet, was genuine. Yes,
he loved her, and yet, he had found the courage not to break
silence for ten days. And she, herself, had permitted matters
to drag along, expecting a message from him any moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the silence continued much longer, she would have
to do something. Gramercy Park is limited after all, and she
would find him if she had to canvass every house on the
Square.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, what had happened to him? Had her defection
driven him back to the old misery and despair? Was he
lonely and hag-ridden, in a music-less hell that might peradventure
drive him to suicide? Or had he perhaps come to
his senses and returned to his wife in sheer cynical weariness?
Of course, that would be the best thing that could happen to
him and she, Anne, sincerely tried to hope that it had.</p>

<p class='c008'>Probably at this moment, while she was worrying herself
almost sick over him, he was partaking of the fatted calf at
the family board.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thought set her suddenly upon her feet. She stood
and looked down into the flames moodily. Why had she permitted
herself to get into such a state of nerves? Why worry
about a neurotic, love-sick boy whom, a few weeks ago, she
had never even met? Why not take the whole thing as an
incident, interesting no doubt while it lasted, but now closed?
She shrugged. She knew all the time that she was desperately
unhappy, and would remain so until she was sure of Alexis’
whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, life must go on, and if she did not dress immediately
she would hold up the whole party. While she had
been mooning over Alexis like a love-sick school-girl, the time
had flown by relentlessly, and soon poor Vittorio would be
back to take up the weary grind once more.</p>

<p class='c008'>A smile of self-ridicule upon her lips, she went into the
adjoining bedroom and submitted herself to the impatient
ministrations of Regina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know I am late,” she admitted impenitently. “But I
had my bath before tea and there isn’t really much to do.”
She slipped out of the tea-gown and handed it to the woman.
“I know just how cross you are. Just how much you hate
New York, and all the rest of it. So do cheer up, there’s a
dear!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sitting on the edge of the white bed, she held out a long,
slim leg which Regina vested with stocking and slipper the
ripe hue of old gold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The <i>signora</i> will be sick if she goes on like this!” muttered
the old woman. “And the poor <i>Signor Marchese</i> looks
like death!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne rose and looked at herself in the cheval-glass with a
laugh. Slim and boyish in her silken slip-ons, gold stockings
glimmering on rounded calves, she was particularly alluring.
How absurd to indulge in melodramatics when one was looking
exactly like a glove-silk undervest advertisement in <i>Vogue</i>
or <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Regina, how she loves her Marchese,” she teased.
She threw a négligée over polished shoulders and sat down
before the gay little toilet table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do my hair as quickly as you can,” she added. “The poor
man will be back for me within the half hour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Regina sighed pleasurably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s a <i>gallantuomo</i>,” she murmured. Pulling out the
large shell pins, she allowed Anne’s hair to fall over her
shoulders in a copper cascade.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is the <i>signora</i> thinking of returning to Florence before
Christmas this year?” she hinted, brush in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne laughed again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a shameless propagandist you are, Regina! Would
it please you if I did?” she added, avoiding the eyes in the
mirror almost shyly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her cherished hopes for the Marchese flaming upwards, the
Italian manipulated the golden coils deftly. “The <i>signora</i>
knows only too well!” she replied with naïve dignity. She
placed a jeweled bandeau about Anne’s head. “The hair is
a marvel to-night, and in the gown of gold brocade the
<i>Signora</i> will be magnificent. She should be going to Court
and not wasting herself upon Broadway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her characteristic snort of contempt delighted Anne. She
led her on to more flagrant abuse, wriggling into the golden
gown in high amusement. Then very regal in a Kolinsky
evening coat, she swept down upon the waiting Marchese.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Regina has been so funny,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took her hand and looked down into her mocking face
with renewed enchantment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The poor thing will never rest until she sees your coronet
pressing down my auburn locks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His laugh was tender.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall have to pension her handsomely, shall I not?” he
said lightly, as the butler opened the door for them to pass out.</p>

<p class='c008'>The night was clear but unexpectedly cold. Over the tops
of the high, narrow houses a hard heaven was studded with
metallic stars. Anne shivered and drew closer to the
Marchese.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This hateful cold, it chills me to the marrow,” she murmured,
between chattering teeth, as they went towards the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped in his tracks, and bent over her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us leave it all behind us, Anne. Come with me to
Italy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The entreaty was almost a command. Anne looked up into
his face with growing decision. After all,—why not? She
had kept him waiting long enough. She was about to speak,
to put an end to his doubts, when a yellow taxi grazed the
corner and stopped noisily back of Anne’s motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>A slight figure jumped out and hurried across the sidewalk
towards them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this Mrs. Schuyler?” inquired an eager young voice.
Anne turned about in surprise. Where had she heard that
intense voice, those words before? Apprehension descended
upon her. She drew still closer to Vittorio.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, this is Mrs. Schuyler,” she answered mechanically.
“What is it, what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>An insistent hand was laid upon Anne’s sleeve.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is Claire Petrovskey. I have come to tell you that
Alexis is very ill, and to ask if you will come to him at once.
He wants you.” The voice faltered. Then as Anne continued
to look down at her in a daze, continued harshly, “Oh,
don’t you understand? Alexis is ill and he needs you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook Anne by the arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden light came into Anne’s clouded eyes. A spasm
of fear gripped her. She threw an arm about the girl’s
shoulders and hurried her towards the motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I will come,” she cried unevenly. “Here, get
into the car. Where to?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She pushed the girl into the limousine and paused a moment
beside Vittorio to collect herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so sorry, Vittorio,” she said hurriedly. “But you see
I cannot possibly go with you to-night. A—a friend of mine
is very ill and I must go to him at once. I’m sure you understand.
I hate to drop you this way, but you’ll take the taxi?
Won’t you? And go without me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A quiver passed over the <i>Marchese’s</i> face. He bowed rather
stiffly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, Anne. You must do what is right. But it
will be a great disappointment to us all.” He hesitated.
“Shall I see you again soon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Compunction seized her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come to tea with me to-morrow,” she said with renewed
composure. “I wish I could explain all this to you now, but
I simply haven’t the time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She touched him lightly on the arm and then stepped into
the car. A moment later she and Claire Petrovskey were
whisked around the corner and into Park Avenue.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Italian stared after them with a strange expression.
He settled with the taxi-driver, then turned to reënter the
house. He would telephone immediately to Ellen and tell
her to procure another couple for the night’s festivities. A
walk down the length of Fifth Avenue, a solitary <i>tâble d’hôte</i>
at some obscure Italian restaurant were more to his mood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />ANNE’S VIGIL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As the car swerved from the curb, Anne sank against the
cushions. Turning to the immobile figure at her side,
she questioned anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Alexis—is Mr. Petrovskey very ill?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The shadowy form retained its frozen quiescence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is perhaps dying,” said the light, harsh voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” Anne’s cry was involuntary. Conscious of the
flood of hatred beating against her, she steeled herself. When
she spoke her voice was well under control.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Surely you can’t mean that! Why, what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The delicate profile beside her, momentarily illuminated
by a street lamp, acquired the translucent hardness of carved,
white jade. “He has pneumonia.” Once more in shadow,
the mask turned towards Anne. A pair of eyes gleamed from
out of dark caverns. “It developed several days ago. He
had had a bad cough for about two weeks, and of course had
taken no care of it.” The dull voice ceased.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beneath her fur cape, Anne clasped gloved hands convulsively
together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, poor boy, and he never let me know!” she murmured
contritely. She faced with shame a thrill of relief. So
Alexis had not neglected her wilfully after all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is he now? Is he—alone?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The answer came deliberately, from averted lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he is in his apartment in Gramercy Park. He is
alone with the exception of a day and night nurse. He—he
prefers it that way.” She faltered for the first time, then
continued with a resumption of hardness. “Women have
always been superfluous to Alexis. I have heard all geniuses
are the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sheer, foolish bravado of it pierced Anne’s heart. The
impulse to put her arms about the proud, suffering, little
creature was almost irresistible, but she repelled it scornfully.
Why cheapen the child’s dignity by histrionics? This was
obviously neither the time nor place for explanations. Let
those come later. The important thing at present was to get
to Alexis as quickly as possible, and with as little friction.
So she said nothing, but gazed steadily at the stream of motors
which glutted Park Avenue like an endless chain of monster
glowworms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without turning perceptibly, Claire cast a surreptitious
glance in her direction. In the constant glare from passing
motors, Anne emerged, doubly magnificent in regal furs, and
jeweled band glowing within the copper meshes of her hair,
the proud face of a patrician, charmingly insolent, utterly
non-committal. Beside her, Claire felt smitten with mediocrity
as with a hopeless disease. And yet it was she herself
who was bringing this woman to Alexis. Why not? He
desired her. Perhaps his very life depended upon her presence.
When existence narrowed down to a primal factor
such as death, one shed all fears except one. Her eyes fixed
upon Anne, she suddenly laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I startled you, didn’t I?” she said harshly, in response to
Anne’s look of surprise, “but the mirthfulness of the occasion
suddenly overcame me. It—it is funny, isn’t it? Just——”
her voice faltered ever so slightly, “just like the movies?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne looked back at her gently. “I doubt if real life could
ever be as complicated as Hollywood imagines, don’t you?”
she replied impersonally.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bitterly ashamed of her outburst, Claire was about to reply
with the same aloofness, when the motor turned into 21st
Street and glided toward Gramercy Square. It stopped before
a tall, narrow house with an English basement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are we there?” asked Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face fiery with chagrin, Claire nodded laconically.</p>

<p class='c008'>They mounted in the elevator and were admitted into the
studio by Mme. Petrovskey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is very good of you to take pity upon my poor boy,”
said a suave voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne felt herself drawn swiftly into the room. An
inscrutable China-doll face gazed blankly into her own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all,” she replied quietly. “I am distressed to hear
of your son’s illness and only hope I shall be of some use.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The small, blue eyes urbanely veiled, were fixed upon
Anne’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid you’re too modest,” continued the bland voice.
Dislike, tinged with a hint of curiosity lurked beneath the
perfect manner. “The doctor seems to think you are necessary
for my son’s recovery, and we, his wife and mother,”
the eyes ceased to bore through Anne momentarily and swept
ironically over Claire’s shrinking figure, “are only too grateful.”
She came a little nearer and laid a massive hand on
Anne’s cloak. “Perhaps you’d better keep your wrap on.
The sick-room is very cold, and you’re not exactly dressed for
the occasion, are you, dear lady?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps not,” replied Anne, a frozen anger accumulating
in her voice. “You see I was on my way to the theater. But
isn’t this delay unnecessary, Mme. Petrovskey? Won’t you
please take me in to your son? That is, if the doctor
permits?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Perfect urbanity descended once more upon Mme.
Petrovskey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” she said in brisk, business-like tones. “Just
wait a minute and I’ll call the nurse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She crossed the large studio with ponderous agility and
tapped upon a glass paneled door. It opened just enough to
permit the emerging of a white-capped head. Whispered
words were exchanged, and Anne was beckoned forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a glance of commiseration for Claire, who had sunk
into a chair next the wall and was leaning forward like a
broken thing, Anne passed by her swiftly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next moment she knelt at Alexis’s bedside.</p>

<p class='c008'>Emaciated, a spot of crimson beneath each glowing eye,
his labored breathing filled the room with tragic effort. Suppressing
a cry of pity, Anne took one of the burning hands
and held it between her cool palms, as if to quench the inward
fire. But the glittering eyes, as they fell upon her, held no
gleam of recognition. The monotonous agony of ingoing and
outgoing breath continued as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will he die?” she whispered to the nurse who had closed
the door upon Mme. Petrovskey, and tiptoed back again to the
bedside.</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman looked non-committal. In the shaded glare
from the night light, green rings about her eyes cut into her
face like spherical eclipses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the fever goes down he ought to live,” she said. “The
congestion in the lung is bad, but so far has not spread to the
other. If the cause of cerebral excitement can be removed”—her
eyes rested upon Anne curiously—“he will probably get
well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He doesn’t seem to be particularly excited? I understood
that——” Anne broke off in some confusion, and then continued
sturdily, “that he had been asking for me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The nurse nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he has asked for you! That is, he has asked for
some lady named ‘Anne’ almost constantly, and I suppose that
means you? You see he has his quiet moments, and this is
one of them. A sort of unconsciousness, you know. I guess
it’s Nature’s way of giving him a rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How long do these periods usually last?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anywhere from ten minutes to an hour. You’d better stay
all night. I’ll make up the daybed for you in the studio.
The doctor will be here soon again and will probably want
to talk things over with you. If you can only be here when
one of his spells comes on, it may make all the difference!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well.” Anne put Alexis’ hand back on to the cover
and rose to her feet. “I will stay, of course. If you’ll show
me where the telephone is, I’ll call up my maid and have her
send me a few necessary things for the night. By the way,”
she hesitated a moment as she reached the door, “are the other
two ladies spending the night here also?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The nurse looked surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, ma’am. They always go home at night. They’ve
probably left already. The telephone’s right in the studio by
the front door. Yes, that’s it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So they had gone! With a sensation of reprieve, Anne
crossed the empty room quickly and got into communication
with Regina.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half an hour later she was installed in the raised alcove
off the studio.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it would be days before Anne would see her own house
again. Days in which she and the doctor and the nurse
would wrestle with fiery death for the life of Alexis
Petrovskey.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />THE HEALING VISION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The heavy glass door rang beneath the tap of impatient
knuckles. Aroused abruptly from fitful unconsciousness
into which she had drifted unawares, Anne sat up in bed
and pressed both hands to her pounding heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, what is it?” she cried in muffled terror. Was
Alexis perhaps dying?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be scared. It’s only me, Miss Wilson,” replied the
nurse’s rather uncouth voice. “Mr. Petrovskey is conscious
and I thought you’d better come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne sprang out of bed and donned slippers and dressing
gown.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is he asking for me?” Her voice was unsteady, as she
opened the door and went out into the studio.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No ma’am, he seems quite rational for the moment.
Asked for a drink of water. But I thought——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes,” whispered Anne. She brushed by the woman
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were quite right to call me.” She stumbled across
the shadowy studio and entered the dimly-lit bedroom beyond.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hair ruffled above the unshaven young face, Alexis’ eyes
stared into vacancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gliding forward, Anne slipped on to her knees by the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis,” she murmured beneath her breath. “Alexis,” she
repeated barely louder than the pounding of her own heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sunken eyes turned slowly and met hers in a blur of
bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne?” he whispered, above his rough breathing.
“Anne?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blinded by a mist of tears, she nodded at him reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dear, it is I. It is Anne.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sound of her voice seemed to puzzle him. He
frowned helplessly. The uneven breathing broke suddenly,
then became more clamorous than before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Strange, you have never spoken before? And your hair—your
hair?” He leaned towards her abruptly, and placed his
hand upon the hair which streamed about her shoulders in a
golden rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your hair—I have never dreamed of it like this before
to-night!” His fingers plunged into the gleaming tendrils.
“It actually feels alive.” He shuddered violently and closed
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne feared he was losing consciousness again. Loosening
the clutching fingers from her hair, she placed his hand upon
her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is not a dream, Alexis,” she murmured, lips against
his parched palm. “Am I not real? Can you not feel as
well as hear me speak to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>At the moist pressure of Anne’s lips, a second shudder
coursed through Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no,” he pleaded hoarsely. “I must not awaken. I
shall not awaken. I want to go on dreaming—dreaming forever.”
His voice trailed into a husky murmur. Then ceased.
His head fell back heavily upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Terror tugged at Anne’s heartstrings. She called into the
other room for Miss Wilson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh come, quickly, I’m afraid he has fainted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her sobbing cry brought the nurse in immediately. She
bent over the bed, then turned a reassuring smile upon Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is asleep,” she whispered, finger upon lips. “The best
sleep he has had, poor young man, since I’ve been here. See,
his forehead is moist. He will get well now. Aren’t you
glad you stayed?” She looked at Anne meaningly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne smiled back at her with quivering lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But had we not better call up the doctor, just to be on the
safe side?” she whispered, hesitant in spite of the woman’s
evident confidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nurse looked at her with condescension. She pursed
her lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all, ma’am. Don’t worry. All Mr. Petrovskey
needs now is sleep. No doctor could do as much for him.
And it looks as if he’d sleep for hours now. Poor boy, he
surely needs it.” Then noting Anne’s pallor and look of
fatigue, “You look as if you needed it, too. Come right back
to bed now and I’ll tuck you up. Shall I make you a cup
of tea?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne shook her head, smiling faintly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, thank you, Miss Wilson. You have enough to
do without taking care of me. But don’t you think I ought
to stay up in case he should awaken again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shivered slightly as she spoke. And the nurse led her
out of the room and closed the door gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re catching cold in this icebox,” she said peremptorily.
“We have to keep the sick room quite cold, you know. But
I’m dressed suitably and you’re not.” She touched the silken
négligée with a mixture of scorn and longing. “Better get
yourself a flannel wrapper like mine.” She smiled grimly.
“Not beautiful, but useful, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With an undefined feeling of shame, Anne trotted obediently
back to bed, accepting thankfully a cup of tea and the
hot water bag insisted upon by Miss Wilson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t afford to take any risk, and pneumonia is contagious,
you know.” She tucked the blankets about Anne
almost caressingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You make me feel so useless and foolish going back to
bed, when you’re preparing to stay up all night!” protested
Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Wilson’s smile seemed oddly motherly upon her
spinster-like face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s my business. We all have our duties, you know.
And I guess you have more than done yours to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One more pat to the bedclothes, and she was gone. As the
door closed behind her, Anne’s eyelids drooped. In a moment
she was drifting on the same uncharted sea as Alexis
Petrovskey.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the morning Alexis was rational for the first time in
days and his fever had gone down several degrees. Anne
heard the joyful news from Miss Wilson just as the day-nurse
was preparing to take the other’s place.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All the same, you had better not go in to see him until
after you have asked the doctor’s advice. Last night was the
psychological moment, and it would be a shame for you to
undo all your good work,” whispered Miss Wilson, her hand
on the front door. “You haven’t long to wait, the doctor will
be here any minute now. Bye-by until to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne stationed herself at the window, and looked down
into Gramercy Park. A mantle of snow overlay everything.
And in the carefully dug-out paths children were playing.
They had erected a snow fort, over which the statue of Edwin
Booth brooded like an austere and arctic angel. A hail of
snowballs from which arose shrill cries and laughter showered
about the statue furiously. Anne smiled. What a picture
the children made, with their rosy faces and brilliant-colored
sweaters, against the blue-shadowed snow! She saw a nurse-girl
approach and open the iron gate with a large key. How
small the paradise! How carefully guarded! How long
before these very children would be thrust forth from the
gates into the sordid business of living?</p>

<p class='c008'>As if to reassure her, the big clock in the Madison Square
tower boomed goldenly. Nine o’clock, and the doctor had not
arrived yet. Anne sighed impatiently. She was not looking
forward to her interview with the doctor. The situation was
awkward. The more she thought about it, the more ill at
ease she became. The febrile excitement of the past night,
under control, she faced the situation dispassionately. Where
was she drifting, and into what? In coming to Alexis’
rescue, was she perhaps jeopardizing against the rocks her
own hitherto well-steered little bark? Perhaps! She shrugged
fatalistically, and going to the table, was about to take up a
book when the door-bell rang. It was the doctor. The day-nurse,
a plump and pleasant little person, let him in. Casting
one penetrating glance at Anne, he passed through the studio
hurriedly and entered the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a feeling of relief, Anne reopened her book and tried
not to listen. But Alexis’ voice, though hoarse and weak,
reached her plainly. It somehow conveyed a message of
peace, as if its owner had attained some unhoped-for refuge.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is really better. He is going to live, she thought, exultantly.
Oh, I only hope it keeps up. She clasped her hands in
her lap feverishly, letting the three voices in the next room
sweep over her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dreaded interview proved absurdly simple after all.
Brusquely uninterested in Anne, except for the effect he hoped
she would have on his patient, the little doctor barked his
orders without ceremony.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient was decidedly better, but not yet out of danger.
All unhappy excitement must be avoided. His mother and
wife were not to see him until further orders, and, Anne
herself, only for five minutes at a time. And at that as
seldom as possible. However, she was to remain within call,
as her presence was obviously of benefit to the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne listened in acquiescent silence, her manner dry as the
doctor’s own. When the door closed upon his plump
assurance, she smiled rather wryly. So she was to remain virtually
a prisoner for days! What would people think? What could
she say to put them off the track? She would have to invent
some tale of having been called out of town, down to Virginia
perhaps, to see her ailing, old aunt? She did not like it at
all, this having to lie! With a helpless little shake of the
head she walked over to the oval mirror and gazed rather
cynically at her own reflection.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was glad Regina had sent the green jersey dress. It
was becoming and informal, and brought out the russet tints
in her hair. What a pity she was so pale this morning! It
would have pleased her to look her most beautiful for Alexis’
sake, but perhaps he wouldn’t even notice? She patted her
hair into order, a new and searching humility in her eyes.
The door opened and the nurse stood upon the threshold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Petrovskey is ready to see you,” she said, her admiring
gaze upon Anne’s hair. “You don’t mind if I time you?
The doctor’s orders were for five minutes only.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne turned and faced the girl, outwardly serene, but her
heart was knocking against her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not. Please consider me absolutely under your
orders, nurse. Shall I go in?” With a regal inclination of
the head and shaky knees she swept by into the sick-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis greeted her from amidst freshened pillows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had a dream last night,” he whispered huskily. His eyes
leapt to hers like wind-blown flames. “They tell me it was
true?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She approached the bed and stood looking down upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If your dream was of me, I was here,” she said simply,
almost shyly. They continued to look at each other in silence.
He put forth a thin hand and fingered her dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne—Anne?” he queried weakly. “Can I believe my
eyes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it so difficult?” she replied. “My dear, they told me
you were ill, and so I came.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sinking down into the chair next the bed, she took his
groping fingers and stroked them gently. “Poor dear, poor
dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fingers crept about her slender wrist and clung feebly.
“I thought I’d lost you forever,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gentle stroke continued.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was foolish, Alexis.” Her voice was barely audible.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You sent me from you in anger,” he insisted mournfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne shook her head, smiling at him with reproach.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, you were mistaken. I never sent you away. It
was you who never came to see me again, or called me up!
What was I to think or do? In a case like that a woman
cannot, does not, want to take the initiative. Besides, I didn’t
even have your address.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The searching eyes had not left her face for a moment, and
as she concluded, they kindled hungrily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you really want me to come back?” The question
was an entreaty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, foolish one. I was awfully worried about
you.” She laughed softly. “But now I must go. Your nurse
will be dragging me out in another minute. And we must
obey orders.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t go, don’t go!” He flushed deeply. “Promise
me you will stay?” Sitting up in bed, he clasped both arms
about her shoulders and buried his burning face in her neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne disentangled herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall be in the next room, within call,” she said rather
breathlessly. “You must be good and do as the doctor says,
or you won’t get well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He fell back upon the pillow and looked up at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it as bad as that?” he whispered with a wry smile. “Six
weeks ago I would have welcomed the tidings, but now, that
you are here, that you have forgiven me, I am afraid.
Promise, promise you will not leave me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A lump in Anne’s throat, she nodded. “I will not leave
the apartment until you are entirely out of danger, Alexis,”
she whispered, her hand on his tumbled hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>He heaved a sigh of satisfaction, and drawing her fingers
to his fever-smitten lips, kissed them pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you may go. If it is only into the other room?
But first prove that you were really here last night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She knitted her brows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how can I, Alexis, if you won’t take my word?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take down your hair,” was his whispered command.
“Let me see if it looks the same as in my dream.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She blushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, I cannot. What would the nurse think?” She
hesitated a moment with puzzled brows. “But yes, I’ll tell
you what I will do.” Her eyes laughed down at him
reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” he whispered joyously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can show you the dressing-gown I had on. Do you
remember what it looked like?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Golden as honey,” he murmured, his eyes upon her hair.
“Yes, ‘seeing is believing.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed, and running out of the room, returned with
the négligée on her arm. At the sight his smouldering eyes
flared anew.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that is it,” he whispered. “Will you put it on for
me to-night, dear Anne?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The flush still upon her cheeks, Anne nodded weakly.
After all, had not the doctor said he must be humored?</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now good-bye for the present, Alexis. See, here’s
your nurse waiting to drag me out by the hair.” She tried
to laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nurse appeared on the threshold, coughing
apologetically. “I do hope you’ll excuse me for disturbing you, but
you see it has really been seven minutes, instead of five.”
The ghost of a twinkle in her eye, she approached them
gingerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, Anne, go if you must,” Alexis sighed mournfully.
“But please, please, won’t you kiss me first, just to
prove you’re really here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne stooped over him, laughing unsteadily. “I, don’t
usually have to answer to roll-call like this.” She pressed
her lips lightly upon the hot forehead, beneath the towseled,
fair hair. “There, will you be good now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The touch of her lips flamed through Alexis’s body. He
closed his eyes in sheer ecstasy. When he opened them Anne
had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>The remainder of the day passed in rapid monotony,
fevered, unreal as a dream, which though sweet, borders upon
the edge of nightmare. After having watched Alexis sip at
a little warm milk, (he was not permitted to talk this time,
only to look into her face and hold her hand), she went to a
nearby tea-room for lunch. Then strolled briskly about the
enclosed park, before returning to the studio, quite like a
professional nurse, as she told herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis was asleep when she came in. She threw herself
upon the couch with a book and a cigarette. Gradually, the
white-gold noon of December faded into violet. Dusk crept
through the curtained windows, stole up the walls, swathing
the room in heavy, somber folds until it became a dim cavern.</p>

<p class='c008'>The book slipped from Anne’s fingers. She dozed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not until after six o’clock that she remembered
having invited the Marchese to tea that very afternoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Conscience-smitten, she rose, and stumbling across the
shadowy studio, took up the telephone and called up her
house. Regina answered volubly, Yes, the <i>Signor Marchese</i>
had been there and left. She had told him the <i>Signora</i> had
been called away to see a sick friend and had not returned as
yet. Had she, Regina, done right? Yes, Anne supposed she
had (with a little private grimace). Had the Marchese
seemed hurt? Regina’s respectful voice became lugubrious.
Yes, he had! He had gone away with an air of great sorrow!</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne sighed. “Please call him up and say that I am
writing, Regina, that’s a dear!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Benissimo</i>, all shall be as the <i>Signora</i> declares,” came in
relieved tones over the wire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne hung up the receiver with a fatalistic shrug. Poor
Vittorio, he was faring rather badly. Was he not? She
would have to make it up to him in the future!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />BALM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Clear and still as one of those miniature landscapes
enclosed in a crystal ball, Central Park shimmered all
snow and sunshine. Goaded by torturing thoughts, Claire
trudged stoically forward. Behind her, mincing carefully
upon the crisp carpet of snow followed Bébé, shivering but
dutiful. It was Sunday and the path was crowded by eager
people; skates clanging metallically from their arms, faces
rosy from the cold. Unmindful of the titters called forth
by Bébé’s diminutive size and enormous dignity, Claire passed
through the throng unawares. It seemed scarcely possible
that it was only last night she had taken Mrs. Schuyler to
Alexis. So endless had seemed the intervening hours, so
weighted with tragedy. Then this morning had come the
ultimatum from the doctor, communicated briskly over the
telephone by the cool voice of the nurse. Mr. Petrovskey was
decidedly better, but she and his mother were requested not
to attempt to see him for several days, as all undue excitement
would be extremely bad, not to say dangerous to the
patient in his present condition. That was all. Not a word
had been said about Mrs. Schuyler or whether Alexis was yet
aware of her presence. And Claire had not cared to ask.
Bitter intuition flooded her, creating a succession of images,
distorted, exaggerated, but fundamentally true. Anne sitting
by Alexis, smoothing his pillow; holding his hand, flooding his
being with the subtle magnetism of her beauty. Images constantly
unwinding themselves, like the reels in a cinematic
film. Until Claire’s nerves were raw and writhing. Half-maddened,
she had thrown on hat and coat, and with Bébé
in her stormy wake, had gone to the park. It was the stereotyped,
daily walk, and yet as usual the crisp air, the glittering
sunshine undefinably assuaged her shrieking nerves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hey, lady, stop a minute!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Heedless of the peremptory voice at her elbow, Claire
walked on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, stop there, you lady with the pup!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The finger of authority upon her arm, Claire turned about
in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Were you speaking to me?” she inquired in amazement
of the burly policeman at her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wuz!” The tone was highly ironic. “How about the
muzzle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” Claire suddenly understood. “Why, I thought he
was too small to need a muzzle. Besides, he has hardly any
teeth left anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The policeman smiled sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the same old gag! They never has any teeth.
Not till they bite some uppish old geezer, and a feller like
me loses his job for lettin’ ’em loose on the street! Name?
Address?” He took out a small book and looked at Claire
ferociously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her indifference scarcely rippled, Claire was about to
comply, when a man crossed the street and interposed himself
between them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter, Bill? Afraid the flea’ll bite you?”
exclaimed a jocular voice. “Here, take this, that’s good
medicine for flea bites. I ought to know, I’m a doctor.
Am I not, Mrs. Petrovskey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man wheeled and Claire found herself looking up
into the amused face of Dr. Elliott.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s you!” Her eyes were wide with surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You thought I was trying to pick you up, didn’t you?”
laughed the young doctor. “Well, I am! My car is across
the street. Come on, it’s a perfect day for a drive!” He
nodded gayly to the policeman, who was pocketing his medicine
in mollified silence. A hand beneath Claire’s arm, he
started to pilot her through the traffic.</p>

<p class='c008'>She hesitated on the curb, looking up at him in plaintive
terror. His professional eye noted her pallor and the wistful
rings about the dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t think I’d better,” stammered Claire. “I—I
came out for a walk, you know. You—you wanted me to
walk!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a timid little lady! I shan’t run away with you.
Won’t you change your mind, please? It’s such a wonderful
day and I’m all alone in the big city. I promise not to be
ogreish!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The dawn of a smile broke the tightened line of her lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if you’re lonely?” she conceded. “It would be
selfish of me not to, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked down upon her in surprise. Why, the girl looked
almost pretty. If she wouldn’t wear such awful hats, and
had a little color in her cheeks, she wouldn’t be bad at all.
At any rate, she was the most pathetic little creature he had
seen in a dog’s age. And a fellow’s heart warmed to her
most unprofessionally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good for you!” He picked up Bébé with one hand, and
piloting Claire with the other, threaded the way carefully
through the holiday traffic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish we had a sleigh and a pair of horses.” He helped
her into the Buick coupé and got in beside her. The machine
started. “It’s a perfect day for the country. What do you
say to driving out into Westchester?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire flushed joyfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’d love it,” she cried, off her guard. “I’m so tired
of Riverside Drive and the Park. It’s my daily penance,
you know.” Her smile faded.</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded sympathetically. “Yes, I know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They joined the northward traffic. With joyful tail-wagging
Bébé leaped to the window and stared out ecstatically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He loves it,” said Claire, and smiled her tired little smile.
“He goes out in the car with me every day, and never seems
to get tired of it as I do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you always go alone?” asked the doctor shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned her face away from the searching gray eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but I don’t mind. It—it’s a good time to think, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” his searching eyes explored the averted cheek, upon
which her lashes fluttered nervously. “Do you mind if I ask
you a question, Mrs. Petrovskey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned apprehensive eyes upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, Dr. Elliott, of course not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t your husband the famous Mr. Petrovskey, the well-known
pianist or something?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The violinist,” she corrected quietly. “Yes, Dr. Elliott.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I thought. Didn’t he have a breakdown of some sort
last summer? I don’t keep up much with artists and people
like that, I haven’t time, but I seem to remember having
read something about it in the papers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire’s voice faltered. She answered somewhat shortly.
“Yes, he was very ill, almost all summer. And now he
has pneumonia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Elliott looked startled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pneumonia? But that is a shame, Mrs. Petrovskey. Is
he in the hospital?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She hesitated visibly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, he is in his studio at Gramercy Park.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He mastered a twinge of compunction, and persisted. It
was absolutely necessary that the girl should relieve her
over-charged heart. That she was apparently in bitter trouble of
some sort had been palpable to him ever since he first visited
her in the hospital. Now that she was home again and he
had met that amiably sinister aunt, he felt more strongly than
ever her crying need of help.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Taken ill while practicing, I suppose?” he continued
casually.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a useless effort to control her convulsed face, Claire
met his eyes reproachfully. Why could he not accept her
subterfuge?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Petrovskey and I are not living together,” she said
quickly, mustering a few pitiful shreds of dignity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor looked ahead at the gleaming snow-covered
road in front of them. “Does he know you are pregnant?”
he asked curtly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, no! He doesn’t even suspect.” She clasped and
unclasped her hands in utter distress. “Please, please, Dr.
Elliott!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the voice went on grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think he ought to be told, that is—as soon as he is well
enough to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She uttered a stifled cry. Then gathered her forces together
with hysterical strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t understand the circumstances! I simply could
not tell him now,” she cried with suppressed passion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you love him?” probed the voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Head sunk upon her chest, a tempestuous wave of scarlet
flooded Claire’s face and neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.” The word was barely audible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor’s eyes rested upon her with veiled pity. So
there was another woman, was there?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you like me to tell him for you?” he persisted
more gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Regardless of the wheel, Claire grasped his arm
convulsively. “I cannot bear this,” she moaned. “Dr. Elliott, I
don’t want to go any further. Will you please take me
home?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He drove to the side of the road and stopped the car. Eyes
averted from her tortured face, he spoke gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Petrovskey, I hope you will forgive me for being
so rough. But I am only trying to help you, in my clumsy
way. I have seen from the first that things were not right
with you, and I thought that if you could bring yourself to
speak out, it would help you. I am your doctor, you know.
And a doctor is in his own manner a species of father confessor.
But I see that I have made a mistake, and a perfect
brute of myself besides. If I promise not to mention the
subject again, will you try to forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His sincerity touched her. With an attempt at a smile, she
laid her hand upon his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, I will! I realized all along that you were
trying to help me, that it wasn’t just idle curiosity on your
part.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should hope not,” he muttered fervently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I just couldn’t act any differently. I seem to be tied
up in double bow-knots. You understand, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her ardent little face pleaded. The wistful eyes sought
his evasive gaze. As he met them his heart contracted. An
amazing childish desire to cry suddenly came over him. Damn
it, the girl had no business to be so pathetic!</p>

<p class='c008'>He caught the groping hand and squeezed it fraternally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s let bygones be bygones,” he replied. “But if you
still wish it, I’ll drive you directly home. However, the
Gramatan Inn is much nearer and I’m a starving man.
Won’t you change your mind and have lunch with me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked so eager and boyish that she hated to refuse him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not very hungry,” she ventured doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but you will be! I’ll wrap the rug about you tightly
and open the window, and by the time we get there you’ll be
ready to eat shoe leather.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” she smiled at him faintly, as he opened the
window and tucked the bearskin robe about her. “But will
they allow Bébé in the dining room?” She clutched weakly
at a last hope.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll smuggle him under my coat, that’ll be half the
fun! And if they put us out, that will be still more fun!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His unaffected gayety was contagious.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are grimly determined to have a good time, whatever
happens, aren’t you?” she said with an ironic lift of the
delicate brows.</p>

<p class='c008'>They glided back on to the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t every day I have lunch with a pretty girl. My
Sundays are lonesome and monotonous,” replied the doctor
simply.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A pretty girl!” she stammered almost indignantly. That
was trying to humor her a little too far!</p>

<p class='c008'>His eyes met her hurt gaze with unfeigned astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter? Have I offended again?” he asked
quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like you better if you didn’t pretend that I was pretty,
that’s all,” said Claire somberly. “Nobody knows better than
I what a plain, insignificant creature I am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are neither plain nor insignificant,” he replied crossly.
“And I’m not the kind of man to say what I don’t mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire flushed painfully at her lack of <i>savoir faire</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please forgive me, Dr. Elliott. I don’t seem to know how
to take things lightly any more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He smiled sideways at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We seem to do nothing but quarrel and make up like a
pair of kids! But how about the appetite? For here we are!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had entered Bronxville, and the Gramatan Inn
loomed benevolently over them from the top of its comfortable
little hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How pretty!” exclaimed Claire, jumping out of the car
almost briskly. “Quite English, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He noticed her animated face with secret pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tries to be,” laughed he. “Where’s the flea? Let’s hide
him under my coat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire looked surprised, then nodded understanding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you mean Bébé!” She handed him the little dog
laughingly. “Remember, if the flea bites, you mustn’t
scratch!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the waiter was kind, and as the dining-room was almost
empty, permitted the beastie a chair between them.</p>

<p class='c008'>At lunch the gayety was somewhat forced. Claire ate as
much as she could of the beefsteak and baked potatoes upon
which the doctor insisted. (Her tentative order of
chicken-pattie and tea had been vigorously pooh-poohed. Why did
women persist in poisoning themselves?) But the food choked
her as usual, and her pretense at appetite was only too
transparent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man watched her beneath thoughtful brows. What
sort of a brute could Petrovskey be to neglect a pathetic
creature like that? He ought to be kicked. He, Robert
Elliott, would like to do the kicking. These artists were all
damned neurotics anyway. No healthy, red blood in ’em.
He’d like to show him! Yes, by Jove, he’d like to—but what
was the use of ranting around like a movie hero? The girl
was evidently infatuated, and no amount of kicking, metaphorical
or physical, would alter the fact. Meanwhile, her
need of distraction and companionship was imperative. She
was obviously suffering from an inferiority complex of long
standing. A complex probably based on the small nothings
which sometimes take so deep a root in sensitive natures. Perhaps
with gayety and self-confidence and a knowledge of
dress she might have held even the odious Petrovskey. But
was such a man worth holding? And why did women cling
so rapaciously to men like that? He shrugged mentally.
(Anything so Continental as a physical shrug would have been
impossible for Robert Elliott).</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire made a feeble effort to talk. One must be polite
to one’s host. But she was wondering if she should not offer
to pay for her own lunch. She did not know how to broach
the subject without hurting Dr. Elliott’s feelings. He looked
so young, she was sure he must be poor. Young doctors were
always poor, and equally sensitive.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you a New York man?” she inquired diffidently.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say not. These Easterners get my goat. No,
I’m from what the novelists call the Great Middlewest, Main
Street and all that bunk, you know. Some time I intend
going back to practice in Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire nodded politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you go to medical school here in the East?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Elliott nodded. “Yes, you see I was lucky enough to
win a scholarship. That led to an internship, too, and then
I decided to stay on for a while. But I hope to clean up in
about a year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Clean up?” Claire looked surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Finish. You don’t understand my argot, do you? I must
seem an awful roughneck to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire smiled delightedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Roughneck? No, indeed you don’t! You see I know
what that means! I like the way you talk. It sounds so
eager and interested and young. Most of the people I see are
a good deal older. You are very refreshing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are quaint,” he laughed. “One would think you
were an old lady instead of a baby! Why, you look so young
you ought to have a wet nurse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned scarlet at his unconscious reminder of her state.
How beautifully simple the man was!</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not very old,” she said hastily, in order to cover her
confusion. “Only twenty-two. But it feels like a thousand.”
Her involuntary sigh was full of weariness.</p>

<p class='c008'>He patted her hand, as it idly crumbled the bread upon her
plate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor kid!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then his eyes lighted daringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you think you’d feel less aged if you wore a more
youthful hat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him in utter surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you like my hat?” Her tone was wistful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t it a trifle middle-aged?” he replied cautiously.
“Your face is so small and pale, it sort of broods over it,
like a hen sitting on an egg. Why don’t you get yourself
something flapperish with a little color in it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire drew a puzzled breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somehow I never thought that was my style. And color
makes me look paler than ever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s easily remedied. Plenty of good food, fresh air,
sleep, and no worry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire’s smile was a trifle rueful. “Haven’t I heard that
prescription before, Dr. Elliott?” she inquired somewhat
dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>His brilliant teeth flashed out from out the dark face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll admit it’s a bromide. But just to prove I’m not an old
fogey, I’ll give you a prescription after lunch which will work
wonders before your very eyes. No—it’s not a flask.” He
laughed as her puzzled gaze rested upon his hip pocket.
“Although I’ve been known to recommend that at times.
And now, how about some ice-cream?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire shook her head decidedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, I couldn’t, Dr. Elliot. I feel like a Strassbourg
goose, as it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“About as crowded as the corner of Fifth Avenue and
42d Street? Well, I won’t insist. You’ve been a pretty good
little lady. But remember, no tea, no coffee, no chicken patties
when I’m not around. Beefsteak, baked potatoes, spinach,
etc. Is it a promise?” He held out a solemn hand across the
table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she placed her fingers in his somewhat timidly. “I
promise. And now how about the prescription?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He released her and rising to his feet helped her on with
her coat, a long, expensive moleskin, which accentuated the
slight sallowness of her complexion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Promise to take it, no matter how obnoxious?” he admonished,
finger in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it castor-oil?” Her smile was almost roguish.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I’m not as cold blooded as you think!” he replied
with mock gravity. “Follow me down to the drug store and
you’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Picking up Bébé, who had fed bountifully off the scraps,
he led the way downstairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prescription was contained in a tiny red leather box.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it looks like rouge!” exclaimed Claire in a horrified
tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some call it so,” said the doctor gayly. “But it would
smell as sweet under any other name.” He sniffed at it appreciatively.
“Come now,” he continued, utterly regardless of
the clerk’s amused eyes. “Come over to the light and we
will proceed with the operation. Shall I have to use an
anæsthetic?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I’ve never done such a thing in my life!” protested
Claire vigorously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s not at all difficult,” he replied. “It only requires a
delicate touch like mine (am I not a surgeon?) and presto!
my lady blooms like a wild rose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He brushed Claire’s cheekbones lightly with the puff,
adding a touch to the small pointed chin. Her lashes fluttering
like the wings of a butterfly, Claire let him have his
way.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stepped back and looked at her admiringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did I say wild rose? It should have been tea rose. I
am indeed an artist,” he said softly, a new expression creeping
into his honest eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire gazed at herself in the tiny mirror. The change
both frightened and delighted her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you think it’s wicked?—why, you’d never know it
wasn’t real!” she cried femininely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not. But like all prescriptions it mustn’t be
overdone. It should be taken homeopathically, in microscopic
doses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It makes me feel so daring,” said Claire, as they emerged
on to the street.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just what you need,” he replied promptly. “Audacity,
more audacity, and still more audacity, as Balzac or
some other old French geezer said.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The drive home was almost too short. Dr. Elliott talked
of himself and his ambition, and Claire listened with real
interest. It seemed obstetrics was to be his specialty, as it
was obviously his god.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have no idea what a need there is for it in small
towns,” he told her enthusiastically. “The countless farmers’
wives that could be saved if they had the proper attention!
Pregnancy should be treated as a real sickness. If you leave
it all to nature, the old lady goes about it in her usual, sloppy,
destructive way. But give it the proper attention and it
responds like a flash.” He gave her a quick, piercing look.
“Child-birth is no longer a bugaboo of the Old Testament,
thanks to science, and I’m going to make it my business to
prove it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A little tremulous and self-conscious, Claire looked at him
with trepidation. Would he be mentioning her own condition
soon?</p>

<p class='c008'>But he knew better than to do that. Gradually, the conversation
became frivolous. Before she arrived home, Claire
had not only promised to buy a new hat, but to buy it in his
company.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will go to one of those places on 57th Street—you
don’t care what you pay, do you? They’ll sting you, of
course, but you’ll get something snappy. Then we’ll have
lunch somewhere and if I can get off from the hospital, go
to the matinée. How about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire smiled happily. Then her expression became dubious.
She was evidently screwing herself up to say something very
difficult indeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter? Shoot,” said the doctor with twinkling
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shoot? Oh, I see! Well, as a matter of fact, Dr.
Elliott, I will go with you under one condition only.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Name it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That you will allow me to pay my own way. I wouldn’t
enjoy it otherwise.” Her eyes pleaded with him not to be
offended.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked nonplussed for a moment, then nodded at her
gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, Mrs. Petrovskey, if it would make you happier,
we’ll have it Dutch treat. But I’m not really quite as
hard up as all that, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had arrived at her apartment, and he was helping her
out of the car with his usual impersonal courtesy.</p>

<p class='c008'>She flushed salmon pink beneath the touch of rouge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please don’t be hurt,” she begged.</p>

<p class='c008'>He smiled down at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one could be offended with a Greuze,” he replied
softly. “And you look just like one at this moment. How’s
that for highbrow?” he finished, with a faint attempt at
lightness.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the words sank deep, carrying balm, into Claire’s
wounded heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Mme. Petrovskey encountered her a few moments
later as she entered the apartment, she could hardly believe
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The cold air has given you quite a flush,” she said graciously
for her. “Where have you been? Ito was worried
because you didn’t return for lunch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>(Ito had worried! Claire shrugged with amusement, and
yet how that remark might have hurt a few short hours ago!)</p>

<p class='c008'>“I met Dr. Elliott in the park, and he took me to the
Gramatan Inn in Bronxville for lunch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey raised dumbfounded brows. Then her
expression changed suddenly. The small eyes became
non-committal slits. She smiled suavely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Elliott? How nice! Do you like him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She watched Claire narrowly as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, very much,” said the girl naïvely. “I promised to
go out to the theater with him next week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right. You might as well amuse yourself,” said
her mother-in-law carelessly, “seeing Alexis is taken care of.
By the way, has Mrs. Schuyler a husband?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire turned away to hide her smitten face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I believe she’s a widow.” Her voice was harsh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey drew a long, hissing breath. “She seems
to be very well off, doesn’t she?” she persisted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very,” said Claire shortly. A vision of Anne, jeweled
and sumptuous in the Kolinsky evening wrap rose before her
aching eyes. “I think if you don’t mind. I’ll go to my room
and lie down a little while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned and walked down the long hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey’s voice followed her almost caressingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not, dear child. That’s right, take care of
yourself. You’re looking so much better already. I think
Dr. Elliott (is that the young man’s name?) is quite a
treasure. We must cultivate him, my dear.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />RAPTURE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mac Dougal Alley on a black, starless night was
quite Hogarthian, decided the Marchese, as he pressed
Ellen’s doorbell, the ultra-chic in slums! He encountered the
fathomless black eyes of the Chinese girl who admitted him,
with a smile. What a white, round face, like an enigmatic
moon. Did it conceal a personality as void as that lifeless
planet? The gorgeous little figure preceded him into the
house. He looked about him with amusement.</p>

<p class='c008'>A diminutive hall had been rendered significant, not to say
sinister, by being lined to the ceiling by large black and white
tiles, and encircled by a Gauguinesque frieze, negroid and
undefinably lecherous. By the door, two grinning sable cats
supported a black marble bench. Leaving hat and coat in
their guardianship, the Marchese entered the drawing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was like going into a twilight grotto. Everything from
heavy brocaded hangings to the deep pile carpet, dripped
lavender. One felt as if one were treading upon crushed
violets. Torrigiani sank down upon a lavender sofa and
stared aghast into the expressionless eyes of a slightly soiled
nude over the black marble fireplace. Her eyes look like
tired oysters, he thought, his mind wandering emptily. And
the room about as cheerful as the inside of a casket, done by
an expensive and lady-like undertaker. The candle in the
tall bracket by his side guttered audibly. He started. Where
the devil was everybody? He had understood it was to be a
large party. Surely he was not ahead of time? No, for the
large black clock was tolling a quarter past eight, and was not
that the voice of his hostess?</p>

<p class='c008'>He rose and walked towards the door. Somber draperies
hanging from white shoulders, Ellen strolled into the room
elaborately languid, as usual.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, Marchese, I see you are admiring my little nest,” she
drawled. He bent over her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am speechless,” he murmured. “It is utterly beyond
my poor comprehension. I feel like the intruding cuckoo.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a purring laugh, she laid her hand upon his arm and
led him back to the sofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are a flatterer, like all foreigners. That is why we
adore you so. But confess, it’s not much like your palaces?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She leaned forward. Her heavy perfume swept over him
with the intimacy of a caress. He recoiled imperceptibly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear lady, our palaces are only called so by courtesy.
Compared to your American houses, they are barracks. We
may have a few treasures, but”—he hesitated, his eyes
twinkling enigmatically. “No such taste, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Confess you think it is all atrocious? But it is only a fad.
You mustn’t take this too seriously. A year from now the
whole thing will probably be done over in flaming scarlet,
festooned with monkeys and cocoanuts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a species of inverse evolution, I suppose?” His comical
expression sat upon him gayly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exotic little Chinese entered with cocktails. Torrigiani
noted with dismay that there were only two glasses. Was the
<i>tête-à-tête</i> to endure all evening? His raised eyebrows piqued
Ellen. She answered his unspoken question with gay malice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we are to be alone. I wanted to have you all to
myself. Am I not selfish?” She handed him his cocktail
with a queenly gesture and smiled languidly into his noncommittal
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Delightfully so!” he bowed ceremoniously over the small
jade cup.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Quel beau geste!</i> Confess you were expecting to meet
Anne here!” Below their somnolent surface, her eyes
searched him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed warily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll confess my expectations did not rise to a <i>tête-à-tête</i>. I
feel decidedly flattered.” His ironic gaze mocked her politely
over the rim of the cocktail.</p>

<p class='c008'>She swept to her feet and led him toward the Gothic
archway at the end of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The beautiful solitude will only last during dinner.” She
smiled at him over a massive shoulder. “After that, the usual
horde will probably invade. So we must make the most of
our time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Torrigiani’s heart leapt upwards once more. So there was
to be a crowd after all? Was Anne to make one of them?
Or would she disappoint him again, as she had this afternoon?
It was the first time she had ever broken an engagement,
and his spirit still smarted from the defection.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a lighter step he followed his hostess. Stopping at
the threshold of the dining room, he exclaimed with involuntary
admiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The white-washed walls of the small square room were
covered with varicolored caricatures of Ellen and the numberless
notorieties who formed the horde. They sprawled
from paneled baseboard to black oaken ceiling, lurid and
ludicrous. Intimate smile and gesture captured in ruthless
hyperbole.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never saw anything so original in my life! It makes
one think of a curtain from the Chauve Souris!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchese went close to the wall and scanned it eagerly.
Although his knowledge of New York celebrities was
limited, he found several whom he recognized. Their names fell
off his lips with a small fanfare of triumph.</p>

<p class='c008'>His childish pleasure amused Ellen. She stepped to his side
and pointed out several more, including herself as Juliet. “I
was dismal in that,” she remarked plaintively. “Even the
Shakespearian flapper doesn’t suit my style.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Running her finger along the painted faces, she let it rest
upon a gorgeous blonde with Titian hair and a glassy eye and
smile. “Who’s that?” she queried, with a mocking air.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment he looked incredulous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not—not Anne?” he begged. The ghastly similitude
smote ludicrously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have said it. Isn’t she dazzling, like a Pepsodent
advertisement, or the ‘only one out of five’ who escaped
pyorrhea?” Ellen laughed loudly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s blasphemy, pure and simple! And neither simple nor
pure. Your artist ought to be hung for libel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went to the table and he seated her. It was one of
those narrow, casket-like affairs with large candles at the head
and foot and an artificial spray of diseased-looking orchids
sprawling over the center.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Chinese girl, supplemented by an equally-gorgeous
twin, passed <i>hors d’œuvres</i>. He helped himself to truffles in
aspic and caught Ellen’s gaze resting upon him maliciously
from the other end of the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did you and Anne go last night?” she flashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>He returned her stare blankly. “Why, nowhere, of
course,” he replied. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen’s eyes glowed in the candle-light. “You needn’t
expect me to believe that! Gerald and I knew you were up
to something. But it was a dirty trick to desert us like that
at the last minute! The evening was a mess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She glared at him rapaciously, as if she were trying to
suck his secret from him with her eyes. Almost too astonished
to speak, he returned her strange look unflinchingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t you get my telephone message?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that! Of course. But it’s such an old trick! A
sick friend wanting Anne at the last minute. It was so very
transparent. Things simply don’t happen like that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He contained his anger with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are a very astute lady, but this time a mistaken one,
as well,” he replied quietly. “Mrs. Schuyler actually did go
to a sick friend, and I myself put her into her car and saw
her off before telephoning you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen opened sleepy eyes. So it was true, after all?</p>

<p class='c008'>“But who was it? Who is ill?” she inquired eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the exotic twins removed the <i>hors d’œuvres</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” replied the Marchese curtly. “But as we
were about to get into Mrs. Schuyler’s car to join you” (he
emphasized the last three words with a little bow), “a taxi
drove up to the curb and a young girl jumped out, ran up to
Anne, and said something I did not quite catch about somebody
being very ill and calling for her constantly. So Anne
went with her, of course. What else could she do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And left you on the curb? Chewing your mustache in
a properly thwarted manner!” capped Ellen, exhibiting a
masterly knowledge of histrionics.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exactly.” His smile was rueful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen’s expression became rapt. Lighting a cigarette, she
leaned back and puffed at it furiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who could it have been?” she helped herself to the artichokes.
Then her whole face lightened with the dawn of a
sudden idea. “I have it!” She looked at Torrigiani gleefully.
“I tell you I have it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His composed face betrayed small interest. Holding his
glass of Château Yquem up against the light he studied it
intently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a marvelous wine.” His hand trembled as he let
the glass down again with a slight jar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen interrupted him ruthlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must have been Alexis Petrovskey,” she cried triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>His olive skin paled a trifle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis Petrovskey, the violinist?” His voice was studiously
calm. “But weren’t the papers full of his disappearance
a while ago?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded joyfully. “The same! And thereby hangs the
tale! As a matter of fact, he did run away from his sanitarium,
but he is back again now, hiding behind Anne’s
skirts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchese winced. He was a little off his guard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t understand. When did Anne meet this—person?
She has never mentioned him to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded wisely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not. Why should she mention him? The
whole thing was rather an adventure, you know, for a white,
woolly lamb like Anne!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you insinuating anything?” His tone was cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen leaned her elbows comfortably upon the table, while
she munched at an olive. “Now don’t get cross,” she said
smoothly. “I’m only repeating what Anne told me herself.
And you can hardly call that gossip, can you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head. “Hardly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it seems that this Autumn, when she was up in the
Adirondacks alone with Regina, she came upon Petrovskey
one day in the woods. He was wandering about, half out of
his mind with fatigue. (He had escaped from the sanitarium,
or was it the lunatic asylum?) She felt so sorry for him
that she took him back with her to the lodge and they spent
the next ten days there together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His pale face became crimson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did Anne happen to tell you this?” The sight of
the food on his plate suddenly nauseated him. He pushed it
a little to one side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen looked at him with gentle reproach.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t trust me, do you?” she wailed. “Well, if you
want to know the truth——”</p>

<p class='c008'>(What else should I want to know, he thought savagely?)</p>

<p class='c008'>“I found him up in her sitting-room the night she arrived
home. The first time you and I met each other, do you
remember?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her eyes pleaded in vain. He nodded shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have not forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen’s tongue passed over encrimsoned lips. “Well, she
tried to pass him off as a legal adviser or something. But I
knew better. I recognized him the minute I entered the
room! So of course I told them so! Later, when we were
alone I wormed it all out of Anne. It’s quite simple,
you see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite! What sort of fellow is this Petrovskey? I’ve
never had the pleasure of hearing him play.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen smiled reminiscently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perfectly fascinating, in a haggard way! And the rudest
thing! He would have enjoyed killing me, I know!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How can you say such a thing!” Torrigiani laughed
wryly. “The fellow is probably in love with you like all
the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook a finger at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re an insinuating wretch! I only wish you were
right. I’d adore to have a genius like that in love with me,
even if he is a nut. But he’s so crazy about Anne that he
can’t see straight. I’m sure I don’t know what’s going to
happen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Vittorio’s heart skipped a beat. “Is this interesting affection
mutual?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I hope not. He would make a terrible husband. So
egotistical, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Husband! The Marchese’s knuckles showed white about
his wine-glass.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he is much younger than she!” Ellen’s eyes rested
upon him blandly. “At least ten years. But you never can
tell what a woman will do when she is infatuated!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He gathered himself together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you exaggerating a little? Mrs. Schuyler has
hardly reached the foolish age as yet. I’m positive she
wouldn’t dream of marrying a man younger than herself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such things have happened!” Ellen’s shrug was eloquent.
“Shall we take our coffee in the other room? I believe I
hear voices.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He followed her trailing draperies out of the room with
unutterable relief. Escape was imperative. He would seize
the first opportunity that offered. In the drawing room several
men were already grouped before the lugubrious mantel and
Ellen’s entrance was greeted vociferously. Sucking her into
their midst, they circled about her like a black whirlpool.</p>

<p class='c008'>Torrigiani was accosted by Gerald.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Marchese, what are you doing in this <i>galère</i>?”
His tired eyes expressed surprise at seeing Vittorio without
Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>Torrigiani smiled politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t belong, do I? As a matter of fact, I’m going
on elsewhere immediately.” He looked guiltily towards
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gerald laughed. “Meditating escape? Well, I won’t give
you away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They smoked in silence for a few moments.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think of the house?” Gerald waved a
languid hand at the lavender walls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Remarkable!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you ought to see the bathroom!” The tired eyes
grinned salaciously. “Done in gold leaf with black frieze
representing scenes from ‘<i>Le Roi Pausole</i>.’ Hot tamale!
Shall I show it to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchese declined hastily. Another time he would
be only too pleased! At present he must make his adieux.</p>

<p class='c008'>Threading his way through the small room, which was
crowding rapidly, he bent over Ellen’s large, white hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Must you leave?” she laughed lazily, “and just as we are
going to play Baccarat? What a shame. Give her my love!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Torrigiani smiled back with well-bred insolence. “I prefer
to keep it all myself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Outside, MacDougal’s Alley was filled with quite un-Hogarthian
motors. The air felt cold and sweet after the
heavily perfumed house. And although his hotel was well
up in the Fifties, Torrigiani decided to walk.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>“Just one more spoonful. There, that’s a good boy!”
With a pleased expression, Anne laid the empty cup upon the
night table. “Hot milk isn’t so ghastly, after all, is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis shook his head. Upon his lips rode the ecstatic smile
of a two-year old whose mother has just returned from the
great unknown.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nectar,” he whispered, above still-painful breathing.</p>

<p class='c008'>She raised an admonishing finger. But her smile was
compassionate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t talk. Remember your promise? If you break it,
I shall have to go. Miss Wilson has come back for the night
and she is very severe, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He caught the reproving finger and pressed it against his
cheek, where the bristly down of a new beard was forming.
His eyes gleamed above the crimson cheek-bones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, you are beautiful,” he disobeyed. “Anne, I worship
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew away her hand, and laid it reprovingly upon his
laboring chest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall have to go, I see. Good-night, Alexis.” She bent
over him and brushed her lips across his forehead. “May
your sleep bring health!” Unshed tears glittered upon her
lashes.</p>

<p class='c008'>He clutched at her skirts baby-wise. “Don’t forget your
promise,” he whispered. “To come back when you are ready
for bed with your hair down, just like last night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A flush swept over the ivory face, leaving it paler than
before. “Oh, Alexis, must I?” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c008'>His nod was tyrannical.</p>

<p class='c008'>She returned a few minutes later, swathed in the old-gold
<i>saut-de-lit</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, here I am,” she murmured from the threshold,
feeling strangely brazen.</p>

<p class='c008'>His arms leapt out to meet her, then fell disappointedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But your hair,” he muttered. “You haven’t taken down
your hair!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It occurred to me that you might like to do that yourself.”
She advanced and knelt beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes—yes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>For an ecstatic moment his trembling hands fumbled with
the heavy pins. Then her hair, a rippling shower of
perfumed copper, fell between them. With a gasp, Alexis laid
his hands in it. Twisting a clinging lock about his fingers,
he kissed it wildly. The tears starting beneath closed lids
he fell back limply upon the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A lump in her throat, Anne shook her head. “Alexis, this
is bad for you. Let me go,” she whispered in a frightened
voice. Beneath the laboring chest his heart leapt up at her
like a caged, thing. It made her afraid. “I must go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no,” he whispered, “don’t leave me, Anne. Let me
die like this. It is too beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a smothered sob, she laid her wet cheek against his.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, you must live Alexis—you must live—for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened his eyes for the sheer wonder of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, do you mean it? Is it a promise?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” her lips mumbled softly against his unshaven cheek.
“It is a promise, my poor Alexis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She unwound the lock from about his fingers. He did not
protest, but only gazed up into her face pleadingly, like a sick
child. “Must you go, Anne?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded speechlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you kiss me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a little stifled cry of pity, she sank into the outstretched
arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>His scorched lips drank of her cool, soft mouth. She
staggered to her feet and stood looking down upon him,
encountering the dilated, rapturous gaze. Had she allowed
him to become so excited that he might not sleep? She
struggled gently to free her hands. “Good-night, Alexis,”
she insisted.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he retained her hands with a new, convulsive force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no. You mustn’t go,” he reiterated. “Not now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat up in bed, and releasing her, pointed toward the
studio.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My violin—get it for me!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>She stood aghast, feet glued to the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your violin?” she muttered stupidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>His quick gesture was full of anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes. Be quick before the music leaves me again!
The violin’s in the corner by the piano.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her heart beating in great bounds, she brought him the
instrument, and watched with brimming eyes while he placed
it beneath his chin, and drew the bow in a great sweep over
the strings.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had all come back with new and overwhelming radiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he broke into the Canzonetta from Tchaikowsky’s concerto,
Anne sank on to the foot of the bed with trembling
knees.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Miss Wilson, frightened, protesting, ran to the door,
she stopped her with almost a disdainful gesture. It was her
turn to command now. Let professional quibbling wait.</p>

<p class='c008'>The music soared a rapturous, throbbing melody, then
quavered suddenly into echoing silence—a silence that vibrated
as if from invisible strings. The violin slipped from Alexis’
fingers on to the bed. He fell back against his pillows and
Anne thought that he had fainted.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was only a deep sleep into which the overwhelming
wave of joy had suddenly plunged him. At least that was
what Miss Wilson said, as she tucked the clothes up around
the thin shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rare tears coursing down her cheeks, Anne looked down
upon Alexis. She lifted the violin from the bed, and putting
it reverently into its case, tiptoed out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she laid it upon the piano, she sank on to the bench
with a little sobbing cry, her face buried in her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank God,” she sobbed. “Thank God!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, back in her alcove, she realized that mortal fatigue
had suddenly fallen upon her. She crept wearily into the
little day-bed and lay prostrate between marble-cool sheets.
Would the tomb feel as cold, she wondered idly.</p>

<p class='c008'>If Alexis recovers I am pledged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dawn thrust an ashen face against the window and found
Anne milk-white, wide-eyed, lying within the brazen mantle
of her hair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />“DUG DEEP INTO MY HEART—”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The sun was golden upon the paneled walls of Anne’s
gay little sitting room. In its uncompromising rays,
Torrigiani’s face shown drawn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne looked at him remorsefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Vittorio, I’m not worth all this agony. Indeed, I’m
not!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I know I should not inflict it upon you.” His
troubled brown eyes rested upon her. “But if you knew
what a horror I have gone through this week! Never in
all the years that we have known each other have I doubted
you, Anne. In spite of what people said (you yourself know
only too well how you have always been talked about) my
mother and I never have listened. You have always been my
<i>Donna Immaculata</i> and always will remain so. Nobody but
yourself could dispel my faith, and even then I should feel
there had been a mistake somewhere. But this talk, this
terrible talk of Ellen, even your letter doesn’t explain it
away entirely. I have come to you for the truth. Who is
this man with whom you have been staying, Anne? And
what is he to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is Alexis Petrovskey, the violinist, and—and he is
nothing to me—at present. He was very ill and I have been
taking care of him. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She avoided the earnest, seeking eyes. A vivid crimson
stained her cheek. In a tea-gown of peacock blue chiffon
with transparent black lace sleeves, she was infinitely desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Torrigiani drew his chair closer to hers. He searched her
face wistfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean he is nothing to you at present?
Don’t try to spare me, <i>carissima</i>. I want to know the
truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She averted her head, and played nervously with the ends
of her turquoise girdle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I scarcely know what I mean myself, Vittorio. It is
impossible to foresee the future, you know. But—but as I
said in my letter, he is very dependent upon my—my friendship.
He says that it is I who have brought back his music.
Did you know about his misfortune, his breakdown?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Vittorio nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I read about it in the papers. So the music has come
back to him, has it? Well, that is not so extraordinary, is
it?” He felt his way. “Things like that usually do come
back to one, after a certain time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you trying to say that I had nothing to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, <i>cara</i>, of course not. Only I don’t want you to feel
too strong a responsibility for this young man. He is probably
very much indebted to you, and without doubt very much
in love. But are you positive that he needs you as much as
he would like you to think?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s anger melted into unexpected amusement. She
gestured with her cigarette. “How can I tell, Vittorio? But
it really looks that way. If I don’t go to see him twice a
day, his fever rises and he refuses to eat. And when I first
met him on the mountain, his condition was really pitiable.
I know that I helped him then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her look of unconscious triumph wounded him to the
marrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me about it, Anne. Is it true that he stayed ten
days with you in the lodge?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She met his eyes with renewed serenity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, why not? He was alone and ill, and Regina and I
took care of him. He didn’t want to return to New York,
as he was afraid the newspapers might get hold of it. So I
let him stay with me,—<i>tout simplement</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked as if a weight had been taken off his heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But why did you not tell me, <i>cara</i>? That night when
I teased you about fallen gods, I little guessed that you were
concealing one up in your sitting room. That at that very
moment he was toasting those feet of clay at your fireplace.
If any one had told me so, I would have laughed in his face.
I always thought you scorned underhand methods. It was
not like you at all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it wasn’t. But how could I help it? It was
his secret, not mine. As a matter of fact, he didn’t arrive
until long after our conversation took place. He didn’t want
to be seen, so I had to hide him. I didn’t enjoy it. I hate
subterfuge, as you know. If I hadn’t always been so aboveboard,
there would have been less talk about me. No one
knows it better than I do! And now the first time that I
have stooped to such methods, everybody puts a false construction
upon it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Except myself, Anne. I know you too well. You would
never do anything beneath you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She flicked her ashes into the grate rather nervously.
“Then you know me better than I do myself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He leaned towards her, deeply troubled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter, Anne? Won’t you tell me, dear?
You’re so different from your former self, so unapproachable.
So almost irritable. Are you unhappy about this man?
Do you care for him, perhaps? Has love finally come to
you after all these years?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again she avoided the earnest gaze. “I don’t know. I—I’m
afraid not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t know?” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.” The word came draggingly from pale lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what is it, dear one? Do you intend to marry this
boy? Is that why you say you are afraid?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.” Once more the monosyllable was barely audible.
Then she turned and faced the honest eyes squarely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot marry Alexis even if I want to. He has a wife
already!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” he breathed painfully. “I understand. And yet
you love him, my poor Anne? He—he is your lover?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head. The firelight leapt up the ivory
column of her throat, tinting her hair with living gold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—not yet, Vittorio.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He uttered a low cry almost of joy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank God! Then it’s not too late. Ah, Anne, think
what it would mean to you to take a lover, you to whom
marriage was a crucifixion! Have you forgotten our long
talks in the garden? How often you have confided to me
your horror of contact? That is why you have always
refused to marry again? Even me, your very oldest friend!
How could you bear it, then, to have a lover?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face cupped within her hands, Anne gazed into the
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t make it too hard for me, Vittorio. Let me
explain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He broke in quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No explanation is necessary. You love at last. And
when a woman like you loves, she surrenders all. But think
well. The ignoble does not suit you. Your love will not
survive it. You will lose caste in your own eyes—you will
be talked about—whispered about——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne laughed grimly. “Talked about, whispered about!
Am I not accustomed to that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, that was different, beneath your notice. Only the
truth can sting a woman like you. Anne, believe me, if you
take a lover you will be very unhappy, I—I dread to think
of it.” He bowed his head upon the mantel.</p>

<p class='c008'>She rose, and approaching him, laid her hand upon his
thick, black hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Vittorio, how good you are to me. Much, much
too good!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I good to you?” he turned beneath the caressing fingers
and looked at her in surprise. “But I love you. I would do
anything to prevent your suffering. If you will only marry
me now, before it is too late, I promise never to demand
anything for myself. We will go first to Mexico if you like,
and then back home to Italy. It will be just the same as
ever between us, only I shall be there to protect you. And
with change of scene and distance you will forget all this
madness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head dully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, it is impossible, dear. But why Mexico?” she
asked, momentarily diverted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I want to explore some of the ruins down there.
And it is another Egypt, you know, as the idyllic guide books
put it. It seems to me that a honeymoon in Mexico, even
only a fraternal one,” he added hastily, “would be heavenly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a little moan she turned away and sank into a chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I can’t. You don’t understand. I’m no longer free.
I have promised. If I break my word now I don’t know
what will happen to Alexis. He is still very ill. He might
lose his music forever, or even die.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Torrigiani turned about slowly and looked down upon her
bowed head. “Do you love this man, Anne?” he inquired
with a commanding note in his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her head thrown wearily against the chair-back, she shook
it dully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told you before that I didn’t know, Vittorio.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He mused down upon her darkly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then it is even worse than I feared. If you had loved
him, a certain rapture might have repaid the sacrifice. But if
it is only pity! Why, Anne, if it is merely pity, why don’t
you take it out on me? Surely, I deserve it after all these
years. Am I not equally an object for charity?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He knelt beside the chair and grasped her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, but you are a man, Vittorio. Able to stand upon
your own feet. He is only a sick boy, an artist, whose art,
his only reason for living, had deserted him until only the
other day. And I—I seem to be able to help. If I stay by
him, it may never leave him again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He dropped her hands and rose. His face took on a hard
expression, utterly foreign to him. He laughed shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see he has appealed to the maternal, the protective
instinct. He is clever, if weak. But is the game worth the
candle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sighed, and spread her hands in a weary, undecided
gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is any game worth the candle, Vittorio, if you weigh the
wax? But if I can help him to get on his feet again, if I
can bring his art back again, I shall feel as if I had been of
some use in the world at last.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Vittorio’s expression became almost a grimace. The curt
laugh rang out harshly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aha, it is the old music complex, is it? So we have put
our finger upon the little, hungry place that shrieks for fame.
Anne, the most exquisite amateur in the world, prefers
vicarious success to none at all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her anger melted as she met his suffering eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is rather brutal, Vittorio, but very possibly true.
Whatever my motive is, the fact remains that I am pledged.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her weary candor disarmed him. He stooped and placed
his hand upon hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Carissima</i>, it is not yet too late. No man, especially no
genius, is worth the sacrifice you intend making. Let him
go his own way. After all, one musician more or less will
make no great difference to the world, which is well stocked
with such as he. But women like you are rare.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked up at him impatiently. “Oh, Vittorio, why do
you insist upon placing me on a pedestal? If I am chaste, it
is not from principle, but from—repulsion.” She shivered
a little. “After all, I’m not a virgin being thrown to the
minotaur, you know.” Her laugh was unsteady.</p>

<p class='c008'>She clasped her hands more firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what is there about this man which persuades you
against your shrinking flesh? What spell has he cast over
you that the rest of us have neglected?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne removed her hands from his hold and pressed them
to her breast, in a dramatic gesture, unlike herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is here that he gets me. His pitifulness has dug deep
into my heart. To cast him away would be like refusing to
suckle a starving baby when one’s breast was swollen with
milk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She suddenly raised her hands to her face and Torrigiani
saw that she was weeping. He cried out in dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, Anne, don’t cry like that, <i>carissima</i>! Why, I’ve
never seen you cry before! If I have offended, please forgive
me. I will go away. I will do anything in the world
if only you will stop crying!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tears trickling through the slim, white fingers, she nodded
her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, go, Vittorio, dear Vittorio. You can do nothing to
change me now, and I cannot bear to hurt you so. Perhaps
it would be better if we should never see each other again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her voice broke. She turned away her head. He put his
arms about her trembling shoulders and pressed her to his
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Anne, that could never be. It is meant that I should
love you forever. I will go away—but I shall return. If
everything has become too much for you, let me know, and
I will come. No matter if it is from Africa. And never
forget Anna <i>mia</i>, that my offer holds good forever!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her head against his shoulder, she stirred uneasily. “Forever?
But you forget, Vittorio, that—that I—that things
will not be the same?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He trembled as the copper tendrils of her hair swept against
his cheek.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I forget—nothing. In the things of the body, it is only
the spirit which counts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She raised her head from his shoulder and looked at him
from under heavy lids. “How good you are, Vittorio!” she
repeated chokingly. Taking his head between her hands, she
pressed her lips upon his. “And now, good-by.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He held her away from him, and looked lingeringly into
her face. A cry escaped him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-by, my Anne, good-by.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He released her, and without turning his head, walked
swiftly towards the door and closed it quietly behind him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne looked after him dully. An odd pain tugged at her
heart. The room became strangely vacant. Deserted by the
winter sun, paneled walls gleamed wanly. Upon the hearth,
the fire lay smothered within its own embers.</p>

<p class='c008'>What had she done?</p>

<p class='c008'>A landmark had been reached and passed; a turning taken.
The homely, the familiar highroad lay behind. The perilous
forest closed in upon her darkly.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a weary movement she raised her bare arms above
her head, and let them fall heavily against her sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ivory clock upon the mantel chanted five mellow
notes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne started up from her chair. It was the hour for the
daily visit to Alexis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />IRREVOCABLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Heart thudding against her ribs, Claire advanced into
the room. Ever since she had received Alexis’ letter
asking her to come and see him she had lived for this moment
alone. And yet, now that it was upon her, she was conscious
only of a cold dread, a dreary fear. Her last glimpse
of Alexis had been in the clutches of delirium. He had then
been calling frantically upon the name of another woman.
Much water had passed beneath the bridges since, congealed,
stagnant water, bitter as the unshed tears lying so heavily
upon her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>She advanced timidly into the room and Alexis rose to
greet her. A wine-colored lounging robe enhanced his fairness.
The smile upon his lips was both pathetic and perfunctory.
Taking her proffered hand, he led Claire to a chair.
For a moment they gazed at each other self-consciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is good of you, Claire, I know I don’t deserve it,”
he said finally.</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiled sturdily beneath her tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You asked me to come, didn’t you? That is why I am
here. I am glad you are better, Alexis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m practically well now. I expect to go out again
in a few days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She noticed that he ignored the beginning of her sentence
and his embarrassment touched her. She looked about the
room in search of a topic of conversation. Her absent eyes
fell upon several large jars filled with flowers. “What lovely
roses, and what masses of them!” she exclaimed impulsively.
Then could have bitten out her tongue. Had they perhaps
been sent by Mrs. Schuyler?</p>

<p class='c008'>A triumphant gleam swept over his face. He forgot to
be self-conscious.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, aren’t they wonderful! It’s quite like the old days,
isn’t it? You see, Claire, I—I am discovered!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are discovered?” she stammered.</p>

<p class='c008'>He ran a hand through his tumbled hair with the old
arrogant gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my return has leaked out somehow the last few
days, and although it hasn’t appeared in the papers as yet, the
exciting fact seems to have spread rather swiftly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Within her lap Claire’s gloved hands tightened upon each
other. “Are—are you glad, Alexis?” her voice faltered.</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed oddly. “Am I human, Claire?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, I know! But don’t you dread having them
find out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her in angry bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Find out what?” Could she be alluding to Anne?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that you have forgotten how to play,” she murmured
almost in tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sprang up and loomed over her with the air of a
young god. His hands upon her slight shoulders, he shook
her gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, but it has come back, Claire. It came back like a
flash, just as suddenly as it left me. Listen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He strode over to the piano, and taking his violin out of
the case, fingered it caressingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, they won’t let me practice yet. And I am
all thumbs. But listen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Violin nestled beneath his chin, he began to play. Superlatively
toned, the instrument hummed beneath his sweeping
bow like a human thing. The penetrating sweetness pierced
Claire’s heart. It sang a plaintive melody, simple as an
ancient love song. The mellow tones rose higher and higher,
finally repeating themselves in head notes clear and brittle as
crystal. As the last note shrilled lingeringly upon the air,
Claire smiled through tears into Alexis’ exalted face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Alexis, how happy I am for you! Shall you play in
public again soon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He replaced the violin within its case, and crossing the
room sat down beside her. “I hope to be ready for a recital
the middle of January. From now on I shall practice every
moment. Do you remember my old manager, Rosenfield?
I’ve engaged him again. Funny fellow, but enthusiastic as
ever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you made any special plans?” Claire’s voice was
strained. Would he never come to the point?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” he hesitated a moment, dreading how she might
take what he was going to say, “Yes, I have. The doctors
wanted me to go South for the rest of the winter, but I
couldn’t bear to go away so far from” he faltered a little—“so
far from New York and Rosenfield. I’m so anxious to
get to work again. So we compromised on Long Island.
The air is wonderful there. I have taken Karzimova’s
house, the Russian actress, you know, until the first of May.
It is an Italian villa, and rather gorgeous. She didn’t want
to rent it, although she is in Europe, but when they cabled
her who I was and that I had been ill, she gave in rather
graciously, and let me have it for a ridiculous price. They
say she is mad about music.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So this was what she had come to hear? She was to lose
Alexis entirely, then?</p>

<p class='c008'>“When are you moving out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In about a week, I believe. Don’t you think it is the
best thing I can do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Alexis, if you are happy, what more can I ask?”
Her brimming eyes touched him to the quick.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Little Claire, what a gentle thing you are. Far too dear
for an egotistical brute like me.” He touched her gloved
hand, and gazed down at her stormily. He noted with surprise
that she was looking almost pretty. Her hat was actually
becoming, and the long earrings lent her an elfin charm.
What had she been doing to herself? Was the pathetic desire
to attract him at the root of the change? The tragedy of
it! Was it possible that he had ever possessed this girl, of
whose body he retained scarcely a recollection? The very
thought seemed incestuous. She was not a woman but a sister.
The little Claire of nursery days, the older Claire of flushed
cheeks and timid ardors, yes, her image was still vivid, and
even dear, so intermingled with her companionship were his
earliest recollections. But Claire, the wife of a few hectic
months, the submissive puppet of rare and intermittent contacts,
was unthinkable. She had existed only within the
hideous confines of his disordered brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>His silence, his gaze filled Claire with horrible confusion.
She blushed crimson. Within the hurricane of his glance her
soul shivered, exposed, naked. What blasting thought, what
ignoble memory lurked behind those stormy eyes? Shame
seared her as with a hot iron. Yet her surrender had been
as pure as it had been entire. Was she not Alexis’ wife?
Bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh? Did not she carry
within her body his seed? With a heroic effort, she raised
her head and their eyes clashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you thinking of?” she inquired with a quiet
hauteur, which surprised him.</p>

<p class='c008'>His answer skirted the truth warily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That you should never have married me, Claire. We
shall never be happy together. It was all a horrible mistake.
Let us undo it, dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot divorce you, if that is what you mean.” Her
hands were clasped convulsively upon each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Claire, we do not love each other. I—I——” he
faltered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know, you love another woman. You don’t have
to tell me that, Alexis.” Her smile was grim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, I want to marry her,” he blurted cruelly. “You
must divorce me, Claire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The searing crimson drained from her face, leaving it the
livid hue of marble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are husband and wife, Alexis. No human being can
undo that now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sprang out of the chair and strode up and down the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That <i>toqué</i> idea of yours! The idea is mediæval and has
died out like a thousand other superstitions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not among the Roman Catholics, Alexis!” Her eyes
begged for mercy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Claire, be reasonable. Be up to date. These aren’t
the Dark Ages!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, poor Alexis.” Claire covered her face with trembling
fingers. “Is it as bad as all that? But you know I
have already told you, you can have a separation any time
you wish. I will go away, far away. You need never see
me again!” Her voice ended with a sob.</p>

<p class='c008'>Struck with remorse, he looked down upon her haggardly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What an utter brute I am. But don’t you see? It is
partly for your sake, too. Suppose you should meet some one
else who could really make you happy? Some one good, some
one entirely different from me. Wouldn’t it be a tragedy if
just because a few words had been mumbled over us by an
unknown priest, you couldn’t marry this other man more
suited to you in every way than I am?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it isn’t the priest who mumbles the formula that
counts. He is only an instrument. It is the spirit behind
it all. We swore before God in his house to remain together
until death us do part. It was a sacred oath. Nothing but
death can dissolve it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you swore to remain with me until death, why are you
willing to have a separation? Isn’t that against your principles,
too?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His irony cut her to the quick.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot remain with a man who does not love me,” she
replied quietly, “any more than I could live with any other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And supposing I love some one else and want to marry
her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would be impossible. It wouldn’t be legal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I am neither Roman Catholic, nor Unitarian. I wear
no label or tag of any sort, thank the pagan gods. And as
I do happen to want to marry another woman, I warn you
now that if you refuse to get a divorce against me, I shall
do something desperate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis, Alexis!” The tortured cry sprang from her
involuntarily. “What can I do? I am ready to die to make
you happy, but I cannot consent to a divorce. It would be a
sin. A living lie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A sin! A living lie! That is all cant and gibberish. I
was sorry for you a while ago, Claire. I pitied you from
the bottom of my heart. But you are hard as stone. If you
had consented to do what I asked I would have been happy
to settle half of my future income upon you, as I am taking
up my violin again. But you are like a rock, as fixed in your
mold as a fossil in its shelf of prehistoric stone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She wrung her hands. “Oh, Alexis, don’t speak to me of
money! I’d rather kill myself than to take a penny from you
under such conditions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He eyed her wrathfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But even that satisfaction is denied you by your church!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How you hate me!” She rose to her feet and faced him
drearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>His expression softened. “No, Claire. I never have hated
you. You are mistaken. I even loved you once—as a sister.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As a sister!” She flung her hands out before her blindly.
“My God, what a fool, what an ignoble fool you must think
me! And I did it all for the best. You were so ill, so distraught.
So unlike yourself. The doctors advised me to do
it. And you asked me, yourself. There was no other
woman! I was so young, I loved you. I had always loved
you, Alexis. The gift of myself seemed small in comparison
with your need. I never thought it would bring unhappiness
to you. Women seemed to mean so little in your life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stepped towards her uncertainly, a horrified question
back of the anger in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But didn’t you know, didn’t you understand why I asked
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cold perspiration broke over her quivering body. The
claw-like dread clutched once more at her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean, Alexis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed cruelly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The interesting little scene in my room, so beautifully
stage-managed by my dear mother?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She rose with a cry. “Alexis! You think I did—<i>that</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?” he shrugged. “The doctor said I needed a
wife. That was a good way to provide me with one. When
a child refuses to take medicine, it must be forced down his
throat.” He laughed excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Alexis, how? Why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She fell limply into a chair and he saw by her stricken face
that she was innocent. He was seized by devastating remorse.
He ceased his pacing abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Claire, this is terrible! I have been judging you all
this time when you were innocent. I might have known
better!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you think I arranged with your mother to have her
find me in your room?” A slow anger flamed in her pale
cheeks. “I may be a fool, but I’m not vile. I—I think I
will go now.” She drew herself out of the chair and started
for the door. He followed her in a few swift strides.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Claire, this is horrible. You must let me explain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She avoided his touch with a visible shiver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t necessary. I understand only too well. I think
I knew it all from the first, only I refused to let myself. I
suppose my aunt threatened to put me out of the house if you
didn’t marry me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he hung his head. “But I really didn’t mind,
Claire. I didn’t care what happened to me, and I’d always
been fonder of you than any one else. Only it—it disgusted
me to think you were not quite—straight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him beneath heavy lids. Her bruised eyes
hurt him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t you ask me, Alexis?” she said, simply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How could I? I was afraid you couldn’t deny it.” He
stepped towards her. “Oh, Claire, please forgive me if you
can!” He seized her hand, but she drew it away quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s nothing to forgive, Alexis. It was quite natural
that you should think as you did. And I—I was an infatuated
fool. Oh, it is all a horrible muddle!” she wailed.
(Tied to the body of a festering love was what he had said!)
Hands to her lips to stifle a rising cry, she staggered towards
the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a remorseful gesture, he put her cape about her
shoulders. His hands where they grazed her neck were icy.
(The festering body of a dead love!) The old dizziness
suddenly seized her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must go!” she exclaimed wildly. She must not faint,
she would not faint!</p>

<p class='c008'>He took her outflung hands and pressed them repentantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is your taxi waiting for you?” His voice was husky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, oh yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Try to forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she entered the elevator his voice echoed hollowly down
the hall, “Good-by.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />STRANGE AND SINISTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Elliott walked over to the window and raised
the sash. “There, that will do, Ito. Thank you.
You may go now. Mrs. Petrovskey is coming to. If Mrs.
Petrovskey, senior, should come in, please tell her I am here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took the hot water bottle from the little Jap and placed
it at Claire’s feet. “If I need anything more, I’ll call you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.” With a solicitous look towards the motionless
figure on the bed, Ito trotted out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire stirred uneasily. A moan broke from the white
lips. The great sunken eyes opened slowly and rested in
wonder upon the face of Dr. Elliott.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did I faint?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You gave poor Ito quite a fright. Fortunately I was able
to come at once. Don’t worry, you’ll be all right in a few
minutes. Here, take this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He held a spoon to her lips and she swallowed the cloudy
liquid obediently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a good girl. Now don’t talk. Just lie back
quietly and see if you can sleep. I shan’t leave you till you’re
able to fend for yourself.” He sat down beside the bed and
took her wrist in sturdy brown fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re so good,” she whispered tremulously. “And I’m
such a nuisance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t I say not to talk?” The tone was gruff, but his
fingers tightened about the frail wrist.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll—be good.” The low voice broke. A moan issued
from quivering lips. “Oh, oh, I cannot bear it! I cannot
bear it,” she sobbed. Her breast rose and fell in stormy gasps.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young doctor leaned over her. “Don’t, don’t, you will
hurt yourself! What is the matter? Tell me about it,
perhaps I can help!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot bear it!” The sobs rose wildly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brown face drained of color, he put his arms about the
slight body and pillowed her head on his breast. “There,
there, cry it out if you must. There’s no one but me to hear
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, oh, oh!” The slight body writhed in a renewed gust.
“What shall I do? What will become of us all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, there.” He stroked the convulsed forehead with
cool fingers. “Things can’t be as bad as all that. Tell me
about it. That’s what I’m here for, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cyclonic sobs increased. He cradled the small tortured
body within his arms and rocked it to and fro like a baby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I were dead. I ought never to have been born!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man was frightened. If this were to last much longer,
there was no telling what would happen. When he spoke his
voice was purposely abrupt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This must stop at once. Do you want to kill your child?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would be better for him if he never were born.” But
his tone of command had calmed her. The sobs died down
into a whimper.</p>

<p class='c008'>He followed up his advantage sternly. “You must not say
such things nor think them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stirred in his arms and he laid her back upon the
pillow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it is true. Nobody wants either of us. Nobody ever
has wanted us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is because you don’t give them a chance. You are
so shy. You always run away. Nobody could help loving
you if they really knew you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She hid her pallid young face. “Alexis doesn’t. He wants
me to get a divorce.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He reddened with anger. “That doesn’t prove anything!
These artistic people must be the devil to live with. Why
don’t you give him a divorce if he wants one? What is the
use of staying together if you aren’t happy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t—you don’t understand——” her voice came
muffled from within the pillow.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked down upon the small dark head with compassion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I understand all right. You think you love him
and all that. Women like you always fall for the brutes.
But it really isn’t love, you know. An obvious case of
masochism. My advice is to divorce and forget him. He
isn’t worth all these tears. There are plenty of men in the
world who would be proud and happy in your love. I’m
sorry this had to come up when you’re not in the best condition
for it. But now that it has, you might as well face the
music.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her great eyes chided him reproachfully. “He is not bad,
poor Alexis. You misjudge him. It is not his fault that he
doesn’t love me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked incredulous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did he marry you, then? Isn’t he responsible for
his actions?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head. “He couldn’t help himself. I was
literally thrust down his throat!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t make me believe that he didn’t know what he
was doing! Of course he is obviously a neurotic. An arrant
egotist. The sooner you’re rid of him the better. He is
taking advantage of your inexperience. And now you think
you’ve got to pay for it the rest of your life. Why, you
haven’t lived one-third of it yet. Give him up. Let him
go to the devil his own way. Don’t allow him to drag you
down with him. You are beautiful, appealing——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think so! Give some other chap the chance to make you
happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The blanched lips twisted into a wry smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are only trying to be kind. I wish you wouldn’t. I
like you better when you’re honest. Nobody has ever been
in love with me in all my life. Nobody has even thought
about me like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have,” he replied simply.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dumbfounded, she sat up in bed and leaned towards him
uncomprehendingly. “You have?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he reiterated sturdily. “I have. Ever since our
drive to Bronxville. And you’ve been happy with me, too.
Didn’t we have a good time when we bought the hat and the
earrings? Haven’t our little supper parties been fun?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A wave of scarlet flooded her face and neck. “You don’t
know what you are saying. Yes, of course I’ve been happy
with you. But that doesn’t mean we love each other! Perhaps
you pity me. But the other is—is absurd.” Her shaky
tones contained both a question and a longing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why will you persist in depreciating yourself? Has
nobody ever told you how sweet you are?” He bent over
her and grasped the tiny hands in his. “Claire, I love you
and I want you to divorce this man and marry me. I know
I can make you happy. I will live only for that. I’ll take
you to Chicago and in new surroundings you will forget all
that you have had to suffer. Listen, darling, won’t you
believe me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew her hands away with a little sob. “But you don’t
understand. You forget——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The baby, you mean? Why, no, I haven’t forgotten him
at all. I want him too. ‘The more, the merrier!’” He
laughed unsteadily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tears gushing from beneath the heavy lids, she looked up
at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you are a dear, and I cannot bear to hurt you. But it
is all impossible. Even if I didn’t love Alexis it would be
impossible. I could never consent to a divorce. You see, I’m
a Catholic!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A Catholic!” His startled gaze rested for a moment
upon the ivory rosary at the head of the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she whispered, “now you understand, don’t you?
And you won’t think I’m ungrateful? Say you understand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His set face retained its look of determination.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose so! But it seems too awful. Don’t spoil both
our lives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hands upon her ears, Claire looked at him beseechingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop, you have said enough. If I had met you a year
ago, perhaps things might have been different, although I
doubt it, for I’ve loved Alexis ever since I was old enough
to know what love meant. Now that he is my husband, I
never could live with another man. It would be shameful.
I never could hold my head up again. But please say you
understand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sudden pallor upon his square young face, he walked over
to the open window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I am beginning to,” he said huskily. “I didn’t
realize that women like you still existed. I—I am defeated.
If you wish, I will not come here again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, oh,” Claire gazed after him wanly. “I was afraid
you would say that! Why, you’re the only real friend I
have. If you desert me, I don’t know what I shall do.
Won’t you please forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He hesitated a moment. His averted face worked oddly.
Then he turned and walked back to the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you talking about?” The warm voice was a
trifle unsteady. “Of course, I forgive you. We’ll never
mention the subject again. I want you to consult me just
as if this had never happened. Promise?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He held out his hand and she laid hers in it thankfully.
Once more the tears were very close.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, I promise. What could I do without you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right.” He cleared his throat. “Now lie down
again. I want you to stay in bed for a day or two, until your
nerves get rested. I’ll send you around a nurse. A nice, fat,
little girl who will cheer you up. You need companionship.
This colossal brute,” he stooped quickly and picked up the
diminutive Griffon from out his basket, “is not particularly
diverting, except to look at.” He met Claire’s clouded eyes
with a smile, and bag in hand, started for the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long, until to-morrow. Don’t you dare be gloomy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he reached the large square entrance hall, the front door
opened and admitted Mme. Petrovskey. Swathed in sealskin,
wreathed with smiles, a coquettish hippopotamus, she
approached him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Dr. Elliott, you here? How charming! But perhaps
I shouldn’t be pleased? Is my dear daughter ill again?
Or is this merely the sad return from one of your delightful
little jaunts?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He bowed awkwardly over the fat, white hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Unfortunately, this visit is purely professional. Mrs.
Petrovskey was taken ill quite unexpectedly, and Ito had the
presence of mind to call me up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She simpered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear Ito. He’s quite invaluable, isn’t he? Poor Claire,
so she is ill again? Quite a tissue-paper little person, I’m
afraid. What is the matter this time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She must have been over-tired when she came in. She
fainted and was unconscious for at least half an hour. I
have told her to remain in bed for several days and I’m
sending a nurse. Not that I think it’s serious,” he added
hastily. Claire wouldn’t want her mother-in-law to suspect
anything. “But she needs a rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Another fainting fit? Surely, there must be something
seriously wrong? Are you keeping anything from me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is very anæmic and her heart isn’t quite what it ought
to be, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t it? Dear me! So her heart is affected, you say?
But surely you can cure it, can’t you, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The large face simpered childishly. He glared at her with
undisguised dislike.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please take me seriously, Mme. Petrovskey. There is
nothing comical about the situation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Unless you except the secrecy,” she rejoined with unexpected
dryness.</p>

<p class='c008'>He bristled perceptibly. “Secrecy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what else to call it.” The coquettish
manner had disappeared. “It is quite obvious that my
daughter-in-law is going to have a child, although of course
she hardly shows it as yet. But what I cannot understand
is why she has not told me about it. It seems very underhanded
and strange, to say the least, decidedly unethical, not
to say suspicious on your part.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Unethical? Suspicious? What do you mean?” he cried,
taken unawares, and conscious of rising fury.</p>

<p class='c008'>The guileless China-blue eyes opened wide.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, nothing, of course, against you! Only I thought
that perhaps there might be some reason for all this secrecy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What reason should there be?” he exclaimed irritably.
“Mrs. Petrovskey, like many other young women in her
situation, has had an urgent desire to keep her condition to
herself as long as possible. I assure you it is quite an ordinary
phase in pregnancy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, is that so? How very quaint. I’m such a very simple
person myself that it strikes me as very strange that a young
woman should not want to tell her husband of an expected
child, that is, of course, supposing it to be legitimate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Elliott’s lips grew white. What in hell was the old
she-devil driving at?</p>

<p class='c008'>“It might seem strange to a casual observer,” he said, very
much on his guard. “But to a doctor it is very ordinary.
Quite a normal idiosyncrasy, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her manner changed, became charged once more with
heavy coquetry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so relieved to hear you say so. Of course I was not
insinuating anything.”—(So she had been, after all!)—“But
it is so comforting to be reassured. I have so much confidence
in you, Dr. Elliott. You cannot imagine what a pleasure
it is to me to see the delightful friendship between you and
my frail, little daughter-in-law, poor, dear child. Let me
see, you have been friends for over a year, have you not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She encountered the murderous gleam in his eye with a
bland smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are mistaken,” he said curtly. “It is not quite four
months since I attended Mrs. Petrovskey for the first time!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear me! I had imagined you had met long before
that. How could I have made such a mistake?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure I have no idea.” A frown between his heavy
brows, he regarded her gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well, it has all been very sudden, hasn’t it? You
seem like an old friend to us all. Why, Claire positively
raves over you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot imagine Mrs. Petrovskey raving over anything
or anybody, least of all a prosaic doctor like myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you prosaic? Oh, I cannot believe that.” She laid
a heavy hand on his reluctant arm. “You haven’t those
romantic brown eyes for nothing. Oh, must you be going?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had edged gradually over to the door and stood with one
hand placed upon the knob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid I must.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am so sorry. I hope my idle chatter hasn’t detained
you from your duties?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her bland, pussy-cat smile pursued him to the hospital. It
haunted the remainder of his day, and later invaded his sleep.
He dreamed that Claire was a canary and Mme. Petrovskey,
in the form of a Cheshire cat, had devoured her. The smile
was outlined with blood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />DISCORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Above a livid line of snow the villa Sirena loomed brilliantly
like some huge ocean liner, against the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>A shiver of excitement ran up Anne’s spine. So they had
arrived at last! “How large it looks,” she said rather breathlessly.
In spite of herself a slight tremor crept into her voice.
Alexis turned towards her passionately. Under cover of the
darkness his face was puzzled, triumphant. This new,
virginal Anne, was at once mysterious and adorable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is rather deceptive at night,” he replied quietly, ignoring
her confusion. “Not really large at all, but I know it will
please you because it’s modeled exactly after the Florentine
villas you love so much. Once inside, you scarcely dream you
are only in Long Island.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a skillful twist of the wrist, he turned the car in
at the gates and entered the driveway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I shall love it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took a hand off the wheel and laid it on hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silly boy! Look out or you will run into the terrace.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had stopped in front of the doorway. Bathed in the
golden rays from the entrance-hall, they stared at each other
in startled silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, Anne,” Alexis’ voice was broken. He started to
put his arms about her. She pushed him away gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be careful, Alexis. The servants are at the door. And
don’t forget I am your cousin, Mme. Simone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got out of the car with a groan. “What a farce. I
hate it, Anne.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not any more than I do!” she accepted his aid. Her eyes
hovered over his miserable face comprehendingly, as she
swept past him up the shallow steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Madame est la bienvenue!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>A broad smile upon his ruddy face, Jules bowed low. He
took Anne’s suitcase from Alexis with an air of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Monsieur should ’ave call me! Shall I take the box of
Madame to ’er room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you please, Jules.” Alexis’ eyes were fixed upon
Anne’s face. “Do you like it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat down upon a marble bench looking about her with
genuine admiration. “It is beautiful, Alexis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The small round hall was paved with large black and
white marble slabs. In the center was a fountain over
which presided the green bronze of a nude girl. Exquisitely
slender, her arms were thrown above her head to support the
masses of hair from whence water spouted. It trickled over
face and breast, over delicate, rounded thighs, polishing them
into black marble, but leaving the slender, curved back bare
and lusterless. The gurgle and splash filled the room with
liquid music, as thirst-assuaging as a mountain brook.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a lovely creature!” Anne encircled the fountain
dreamily. “But doesn’t her back ever get wet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, she is like an ostrich. What she doesn’t see simply
doesn’t exist. I find her very irritating. I often splash her
in revenge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How ungentlemanly!” Anne laughed. She moved away
aimlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He put his arm through hers almost timidly. “Would you
like to see your room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?” Her voice was deliberately careless.</p>

<p class='c008'>They mounted the curving, marble stairs, arm in arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you will like it. It is a bit rococo.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I shan’t mind. I know Karzimova’s taste is supposed
to be somewhat barbaric. It will be quite amusing to occupy
her room. But weren’t you in luck to get hold of her villa?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, wasn’t I?” he said simply. They had reached the
large landing. Turning to the right, they entered a Gothic
corridor. “Here you are.” He stopped before an open door
and stood aside for her to precede him. “Remember, I
warned you,” he finished apologetically.</p>

<p class='c008'>The entire room was done in old gold and turquoise brocade.
A narrow, Empire bed, with a canopy, stood lengthwise
against the wall. Large, French windows outlined by turquoise
hangings, and swathed in heavy lace, opened out on to
an iron balcony. A few French prints perched naughtily upon
the walls. On the Buhl dressing table was a large Tiffany
bowl filled with gardenias. Their amorous scent rose upon
the air triumphantly. Anne stooped over them, and inhaled
the heady fragrance. It penetrated and warmed her brain
like old wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She started slightly at the sound of his voice directly behind
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A temple of love—but not at all respectable, my friend.”
Her laugh was both cynical and uncertain. She seated herself
on the edge of the bed rather gingerly. The turquoise satin
cover rustled voluptuously beneath her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel like Zola’s Nana, or what’s her name in Pierre
Louys’ ‘Aphrodite’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed angrily. “I know it is in atrocious taste.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out her hand with a pretty, contrite gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t worry, dear. After all, we are ourselves, aren’t
we? Our surroundings can’t change that. And I shall certainly
be very comfortable.” Once more her laugh rippled
out uncontrollably. “Did you get the gardenias because the
room shrieked for them, or because you really like them?”
she demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crouched at her feet, he leaned his cheek against her
outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I love them,” he confessed. “Is it low-brow of me?
But their whiteness and fragrance remind me of you. And
they are mysterious and exotic, which is another point of
resemblance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed tenderly, her hand nestled against his blonde
mane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why will men always call me mysterious? Is it because,
although I have red hair, my lashes and brows happen
to be black instead of white like a guinea pig’s?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps that is one reason. And then you are so very
white and slim, a tower of ivory!” He turned his head
lazily and brushed her palm with his lips. “But your
flesh isn’t cold like ivory, it is as white and warm as new
milk. Anne, kiss me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He threw back his head, exposing the full young throat
that always fascinated her. She bent low and their lips
crushed against each other. A flush spreading beneath her
smooth pallor, she raised her head and looked down at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What time is it?” she inquired abruptly. “It must be
quite late. I ought to be dressing for dinner, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, stay just as you are, dearest. You look beautiful.
Besides, I can’t bear to lose the time!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Crazy boy!” She removed him gently and rose to her
feet. “What time do you dine?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eight o’clock, I suppose.” He looked abused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must hurry then. It is long after seven. Come now,
be good and run away.” She patted his cheek. “Would
you have me a Cinderella in such gorgeousness as this?”
She waved a dramatic hand towards the hangings. Her lips
curved mockingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” he shrugged. “Shall I send Elvira to help
you? That is Jules’ wife, and the only female in the
house. She is probably dying of curiosity to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I hate to commit murder, but as I haven’t Regina
with me, I’d rather get along by myself. I shall manage
somehow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He strolled regretfully towards the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if you need help, just stamp on the floor. My
rooms are directly beneath these, in the bachelor suite. It
would be so heavenly to have to hook you up, or something.
As if we were really married?” His eyes were wistful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear boy!” She smiled at him between raised arms.
She was removing her hat. Her long slim body, thrown
slightly backwards, reminded him of the bronze in the fountain
below. “I am wearing a tea-gown and there will be
no hooks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘There ain’t goin’ to be no core.’” His little, rueful
laugh rang down the hall behind him.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later, in the bath-room, she gazed about her in
amusement and despair. Oh, for the cool, white tiles of
her own chaste, little sanctuary! This one was Moorish
in style, with a shallow bench running all around the sunken
bath of turquoise tiles. A huge dolphin’s head served as a
faucet. As she turned the tap it spouted a crystal stream.
She slid down into the water with a laugh. The glistening of
goldfish outlined in mosaic upon the bottom of the tub
had caught her eye. But her body, luminous in the bluish
tint cast by the tiles, elongated beneath the rippled surface
of the water, gave her a sensuous pleasure. Pink-tipped, the
ivory hillocks of her breast thrust upwards. Slim flanks
melted into shadow. She sighed luxuriantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dinner was served in the large, lunetted dining room.
The refectory table was drawn up against the frescoed
wall, and Anne and Alexis sat side by side upon a long bench.
In a clinging, sleeveless gown of white velvet, a small knot
of gardenias pinned against the red-gold of her hair, Anne’s
beauty made Alexis’ brain reel. He longed for the meal to
be over, so that he might have her all to himself. The
gallant subservience of old Jules irritated him almost to a
frenzy. This woman was his. The firm column of her
throat, the gleaming pilasters of her arms. She was a
temple, he the high priest. His alone the inner shrine.</p>

<p class='c008'>After an interminable agony, Jules brought coffee and left
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne was laughing softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was remembering the bathroom,” she said, in answer
to his look of inquiry. “It demoralized me completely. Even
to the stealing of some of Karzimova’s bath salts. I usually
hate a perfumed bath, but the <i>mise en scène</i> fairly shrieked
for it. I hope I don’t smell too strong?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He leaned so close that his flaring nostrils grazed her
hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is hard to tell where the gardenias begin and you
end,” he laughed excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She encountered his flaming eyes with a little thrill of fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I felt more than ever like the heroine of ‘Aphrodite,’”
she continued moving away rather nervously. “Do you remember
the famous bath?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His tension relaxed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope the resemblance was not too accurate?” He
laughed daringly. She blushed, and bending forward, chose
a peach from the amber bowl in front of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What gorgeous fruit for December! You’re an extravagant
creature!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He helped himself to a sprawling bunch of black grapes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why shouldn’t I be? I sold a bond the other day, and
in six weeks I give my first recital. After that, as you
know, my time is completely booked. Rosenfield is a slave-driver.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he is a good manager. He’s so enthusiastic about
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shrugged indifferently. “I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And do you really find it easier to practice here than
in New York?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes. It is so divinely quiet. And then the air is
so good. I walk two hours a day, as the doctor told me
to do. It would have been an awful bore to have had to go
South. You couldn’t have come with me and I should have
gone mad. As it is—I am in heaven!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne paled. His fervor always frightened her. How
could such happiness last?</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I can only come occasionally, you know, dear. It is
difficult for me to get away. I have to make excuses,” she
faltered. “Excuses, even to Regina. I feel sure she suspects
something. Subterfuge is horrible. I loathe it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Head drooping upon its slender stem, she looked like a
chidden child. A spasm of fear swept over his face. Anne
was suffering. Was it all too much for her? God, if
he were only free to marry! Hatred for Claire gripped his
vitals like a vise. He rose and stood over her trembling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, you will not give me up? It would kill me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stiletto anguish of his cry tore her soul.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, my poor Alexis.” She stood up and laid her
hands on his shaking shoulders. “Come, you are over-excited.
Let’s go into the other room. I want you to play for me.
But only a little, for I know you are tired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, of course, I will play to you, but first I have
something to show you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His young voice was excited. He slipped his hand into the
warm crook of her elbow and led her into the salon. The
many vases and jars were filled with dark red, almost black,
roses, Anne’s favorite flowers. She smiled. The boy had
forgotten nothing. Sinking into a small sofa before the
large, hooded fireplace, she looked up at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This reminds me of my villa in Florence. Only more
gorgeous, of course. I love the carved ceiling and the stone
floors. The tapestries look quite genuine, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe they are supposed to be.” His tone was absent.
He took a small package from the table and brought it to
her almost shyly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this for me?” She glanced up in surprise. He
nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Open it.” The intense face bent over her eagerly, while
she removed the paper wrapping.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How exquisite!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a small wooden coffer such as Florentine women
had used to contain jewelry. The lid was rounded and on
it was painted a replica in miniature of Botticelli’s Venus
rising from the sea. The lovely faded colors were like a
greeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never saw anything so lovely! Where did you get
it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve had it for years. But I thought you’d like it. But
aren’t you going to open it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there anything in it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look and see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A green velvet jewel-case lay ensconced within the polished
interior.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” Anne’s heart sank. She opened the case with a
feeling of cold apprehension.</p>

<p class='c008'>Livid flashes of emeralds. White fire of diamonds. Anne
turned away dazzled eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis, how could you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He lifted the bracelet and held it out to her coaxingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you like it, dear?” His voice was infinitely tender.
“Let me put it on for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is beautiful, but I cannot take it, Alexis. Please put
it away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You cannot take it? Why not?” His voice was desperate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot accept such a valuable gift, dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not from me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Especially not from you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh my God, are you going to be conventional, Anne?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You should not be the one to accuse me of that, Alexis!”
She had risen and they were staring at each other angrily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you loved me, you’d take it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t understand,” she said more gently. “I should
feel as if I had lost caste. And besides, you ought not
to afford it. Dearest, can’t you see I don’t want to be an
expense, or drag on you in any way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Expense! Drag! If you were my wife you’d take it,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is a different story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it’s not my fault you are not, is it? I wish to
heaven you were. Then I could be sure of you. This incompleteness
is killing me.” He flung himself face downwards
upon the sofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis, be reasonable!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I were dead! You have never loved me. All
you have ever given me was in pity. If you cared for me,
you’d take my gift and wear it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An expression of abnegation upon her face, she stooped
and picked up the bracelet from where he had flung it
on the rug between them. “Alexis, look. See? It is
on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, you darling!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sprang to his feet, and catching her in his arms, carried
her to the sofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be careful. You will hurt yourself,” she cried breathlessly.
“Remember, I am as tall as you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His arms about her, he laughed crazily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, but you are light, light as a moonbeam, and as
luminous. Light as my heart!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a gesture, maternal in its compassion, she wound
her arms about his neck, and drawing his face down to
hers, offered him her mouth. Teeth pressed against the
fruit-like flesh, he ran his lips along her chin and bare
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, I am hungry and thirsty for you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a sigh of relinquishment, she relaxed in his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>A bell pealed derisively through the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis sprung to his feet with an impatient exclamation.
Anne sat up hastily and smoothed her hair with nervous
fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The door bell.” He was pale from the sudden recoil.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But does any one know you are here? Who can it be
at this hour?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“God knows.” Their eyes met in sudden confusion, a
sweet secret shame, then scattered self-consciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Came a discreet knock on the door, and Jules entered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Excuse it, <i>Monsieur</i>, but zere is a lady who desires to
speak to <i>Monsieur</i>.” His air of apology was comical.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did she say who she was?” Alexis’ voice was elaborately
careless.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, <i>Monsieur</i>. She say she good friend of <i>Monsieur</i>.
’Er name ees Miss Ellen Barnes. Er automobile is—vot you
call it—stalled in ze snow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis nodded briefly. “Very well, Jules. Tell her I
will be right down. You may go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The little man trotted out hastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ellen!” Alexis’ expression was murderous. “She has
been on our trail ever since you had her to tea with us before
I left New York!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s hand went to her mouth. “She must not see me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her distress put him on his metal. He laid his arm about
her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be frightened, dear. She won’t discover a thing.
Run to your rooms. I will go down and see the comedy
through.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, I know I can rely upon you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened the door and she slipped out upon the landing
and up the stairs. As she disappeared around the bend,
Alexis started downwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>Accompanied by Gerald Boynton and two strangers, Ellen
was waiting in the octagonal hall. They were giggling so
hard at the fountain that Alexis had to cough twice before
they became aware of his presence. Upon catching sight of
him Ellen swept forward gayly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were admiring your companion,” she drawled with a
little dry laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is hardly entertaining,” replied Alexis. “But I hear
you are in trouble. What can I do to help?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, nothing, thank you. I guess the chauffeur can
manage by himself. Our wheel came off just as we were
passing your driveway. Wasn’t it too providential? It might
have happened out in the open country.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very providential.” Alexis’s brows were quizzical.
“Won’t you come upstairs while you are waiting? I’ll send
my chauffeur out to help your man.” He nodded to Jules.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’d love to. But I forgot to introduce my friends.
What must you think of me?” She was already half way
up the flight of stairs. “This beautiful little person is Miss
Olive Fay of the ‘Cloggers.’” She pushed forward a fluffy
little blonde with large, ingenuous eyes. “You have heard
of her, I am sure. Her fame has gone abroad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have seen your photograph in the Sunday papers. Miss
Fay.” Alexis bowed formally over the tiny paw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am much nicer, aren’t I?” She pouted pretty painted
lips, and looked up at him beneath darkened lashes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Much!” His ironic inflection piqued her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And this is Señor Caldenas. He paints portraits of society
ladies. He is rapidly acquiring a fortune because he insists
upon their posing in mediæval costumes and compares their
souls to the Mona Lisa.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is because I believe in reincarnation,” the little man
smiled affably up at Alexis, who warmed up to him most
unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And this is Mr. Boynton. He was at Anne’s for tea.
Do you remember?” Ellen’s eyes were amused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, how could I forget an occasion like that?”
Alexis’ voice was cool.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had reached the landing and he stood aside as they
entered the large salon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it is the old world!” exclaimed the Spaniard,
advancing into the room with small prancing steps. “Quite
<i>vieux monde</i>. I congratulate you. Absolutely authentic,
although a little new and smelling of varnish, if one may
say it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen sank into a highbacked chair, laughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Even Florentine villas were young once! Pedro would
like to have everything covered with dry rot. He doesn’t
enjoy sitting in a chair unless it is ready to break under him.
He won’t even come to see me any more, because he says my
house upsets his functional system.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s true. It does.” Caldenas nodded like a serious baby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I notice he doesn’t object to musical comedy, and that’s
pretty up to date,” giggled the fluffy one.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Spaniard shrugged up to his ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, my dear lady, musical comedy is as old as woman’s
oldest profession!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lewd creature!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Apropos of that, as Lord Dundreary would remark, have
you seen Anne lately, Petrovskey?” Gerald’s drawl drove
the blood into Alexis’ face.</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw Ellen’s eyes encounter Gerald’s with a significant
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have not seen Mrs. Schuyler,” Alexis emphasized the
prefix, “for at least a week. You see, my doctor recommended
country air and quiet. So I’m following his orders.
And incidentally, preparing for my recital in January.” He
strolled over to Ellen and seated himself on a carved stool
at her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how did you happen to be out in these wilds, in this
wintry weather?” His eyes probed her ironically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her poise remained unshaken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you see, we were all dining with some friends in
Glen Cove. Fortunately, it was Sunday night and Olive and
I were free. We passed right by here on the way. You
know the rest.” She smiled challengingly into his angry
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must be tired,” he said, forcing himself to be
courteous. He rose and pulled the crimson bell-rope. “What
will you have? Cocktails or whisky and soda?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whisky and soda. That’ll suit us all right, won’t it,
children?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They all agreed except Caldenas, who demanded <i>cognac</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is, if you have it, in this thirst-beridden country?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet he has with the rum runners not two miles from
his windows!” said Gerald.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think there is a bottle or two,” Alexis smiled almost
genially. The Spaniard, under other circumstances, would
have been quite endurable. There was something naïvely
wise about him that appealed to one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jules entered and took Alexis’ order.</p>

<p class='c008'>A cigarette between her lips, Ellen strolled about the large
room. She leaned across a table and sniffed at the red roses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do yourself well, Mr. Petrovskey, ‘roses in December!’
Isn’t that the title of a song? Sent by some admirer,
I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or did we come in upon a party?” Olive’s ingenuous
eyes were fixed upon Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is this?” exclaimed Ellen before he could reply.
She held up the empty jewel case. “Have you been giving
yourself presents?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis’ hands clenched. His nails bit into the palms
savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not guilty, Miss Barnes. That box must have been left
by the former owner. Let me see it.” He took the box
from Ellen’s fingers and pocketed it quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fluffy one danced up to Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe him. It’s a present from some woman.
Show me your wrist, Mr. Petrovskey. I want to see your
mascot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised his hands and shook them above his head. “Now
will you believe me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be careful. Jewelry isn’t safe when Olive is around,”
warned Ellen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what wonderful hands you have, Mr. Petrovskey.
Are they insured?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis laughed. “Yes, but my temper isn’t, Miss Fay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ooh! Snubbed!” She pretended to cry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jules came in with the drinks and passed them around.
The ice in the tall glasses clinked invitingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To our host,” said the Spaniard, returning from a tour
about the room. He held up his <i>cognac</i> and bowed
ceremoniously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And his invisible guest,” muttered Gerald, gulping down
his whisky.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis did not drink. Anne loathed a whisky-laden breath.
He sat down at the piano and allowed his fingers to wander
over the keys.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, do play, Mr. Petrovskey. I’m just crazy to hear
you!” The fluffy one pirouetted up to the piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jules reëntered the room, accompanied by Ellen’s chauffeur.
She beckoned him across the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter, George? Can’t you fix the car?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No ma’am, I can’t. The key to the wheel is lost, and
there ain’t a garage open anywheres. I’ve been all over the
country with Mr. what’s his name’s chauffeur.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen’s eyes were glued expectantly upon Alexis. “What
shall we do?” she wailed.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her and then at the others, with an amused
expression. Their air of open-mouthed expectancy was ludicrous,
and reminded him of a lot of goldfish waiting to be
fed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid you will have to resign yourselves to spending
the night,” he said suavely. “I can easily put you up.”
(Far more easily than I can put up with you).</p>

<p class='c008'>“How delightful of you. It will be quite an adventure.”
Ellen rolled her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m simply crazy about the idea. You know, I’ve fallen
dreadfully in love with you, Mr. Petrovskey.” Olive laid
her hand upon the keyboard, ingratiatingly. He shook it off
lightly and rose from the piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure you’re all worn out,” he said, longing to be rid
of the pack of them. “I’ll go and see about your rooms at
once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite the <i>châtelain</i>,” drawled Gerald, throwing himself
down beside Ellen. He lowered his voice suddenly. “Well,
you lost! She is not here!” A sluggish gleam of triumph
flickered in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you fool yourself. Everything points to it. From
the condition of Petrovskey’s hair when we arrived, to the
jewel case. Besides, I smell her perfume.” She sniffed
audibly. “It’s the mixture Bazani put up for her, himself.
Very faint, but gets there, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed disagreeably. “So do you, Ellen. You make
me feel like Dr. Watson. You win the gold needled hypodermic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you sniffling about? Have you, too, caught
cold?” Olive sat down on the sofa opposite. “Isn’t it too
exciting to be laid up here all night? I just adore Petrovskey!
He is so cold and wonderful-looking, so <i>distingay</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Almost as ’aughty as an English butler,” snarled Gerald,
his eyes upon the other end of the room, where Caldenas was
examining a portrait with the aid of a small magnifying
glass.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis returned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your rooms are ready.” His eyes darted from one face
to the other. “Would you like to go to bed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen rose with a yawn, her hand clapped against her
mouth rhythmically. “Do show us the house first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, please.” Olive’s fingers closed upon his arm. “Lead
me to it,” she screamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took them into the dining room. Caldenas was in an
ecstasy, but Ellen interrupted impatiently. She pushed by the
others, passed through the salon again and out into the hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the bedrooms I want to see.” She hurried up the
stairs, with a malicious look at Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Olive, clinging to his arm like a sack of potatoes, he
followed as swiftly as possible, Gerald and the puzzled Spaniard
brought up the rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ellen turned into the corridor and stopped before Anne’s
door. She tried the knob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s locked!” she exclaimed, challenging Alexis with her
eyes. “I’m sure this must have been Karzimova’s room. Do
let us in. I’m crazy to see it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Very pale, Alexis disentangled himself from Olive and
stepped forward quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t the key.” He leaned against the wall to conceal
trembling knees. “Karzimova stipulated it should not
be used in her absence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bluebeard, give us the key! Whom are you concealing
in there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you’re mean,” broke in Olive. “I want to go in,
too. They say she is so wicked, you know. Full of secret
vices.” She opened empty eyes at the group to inquire plaintively,
“What are secret vices?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is nothing concealed that shall not be revealed,”
quoted Gerald sanctimoniously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You Americans!” laughed Caldenas. “How you love the
stolen jam! Is it not so, poor children?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Under cover of the laughter, Gerald drew nearer to Ellen.
“Come on, let’s go,” he whispered. “You can’t expect a
fellow to unlock his own doors if he doesn’t want to.
Besides, we’ve seen enough!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” Ellen raised her voice. “You’re a tightwad,
Mr. Petrovskey, but we give in. You may spank us and put
us to bed, like the old woman in the shoe if you want to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They trooped back noisily down the hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elvira appeared at the other end of the corridor. Her
plump figure looked beautiful to Alexis. “The rooms are
ready, <i>Monsieur</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sighed with relief. Leading them down another hallway,
he entered a distant wing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here you are. Good-night, I hope you’ll be comfortable!”
He struggled to conceal his delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>They parted from him with effusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much later, a solitary figure in a wine-colored dressing
gown crept up the stairs and stopped in front of Anne’s door.
It scratched at the panel delicately, but received no response.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wintry dawn, gray, disconsolate, filtered in at Alexis’
window. The dressing gown still about him, he lay face
downward upon his solitary bed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />A CRESCENDO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Anne stirred uneasily. One slim, bare arm emerged
from beneath the satin coverlet and wavered towards
her face. The depths of her exhausted sleep, suddenly violated,
rippled and broke. Returning consciousness beat against
her like a gusty wave. She sat up in bed and looked towards
the open window in puzzled astonishment. To her amazement,
it was already daylight, and the raucous cry of a motor
siren was shrilling stridently.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a sickening thud, recollection fell upon her. She
sprang out of bed and ran towards the open window. Hiding
behind the heavy curtains, she gazed down onto the snow-covered
driveway below. As she had expected, there was
Ellen’s car, and in a little group on the terrace above it, was
Ellen, herself, surrounded by the others. They were bidding
an effusive farewell to Alexis, who, with his back turned
toward the house, stood hatless and coatless at the top of the
steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>He will catch cold again, thought Anne, as with chattering
teeth she wound the heavy curtain about her. Oh,
why don’t they hurry? Her eyes fell upon the thick-set figure
of the Spaniard. Caldenas! She shook with inward amusement.
What is he doing in this <i>galère</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>Hat jammed over his face, Gerald Boynton leaned close to
Ellen’s massive shoulders, whispering in her ear. They
turned, and raking the far side of the house, eyed Anne’s
balconied window. Beneath the vulture-like stare, Anne
shivered and concealed herself more closely within the enfolding
curtain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Olive Fay, small, fur-clad, clung limply to Alexis’ arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bye-bye, Mr. Petrovskey, I’m just furious we’ve got to
beat it so early. Bother these rehearsals, anyway!” Her tone
shrilled up to Anne on the icy air. “You won’t forget that
box you promised me for your concert, will you? I’m not
strong for the high-brow stuff, but I’ve certainly fallen for
you, and it’ll give the dear public a shock to see me in
Carnegie Hall.” She sprang nimbly down the steps and
hopped into the motor. Flesh-colored stockings gleamed upon
rounded calves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we shall all be there, <i>en masse</i>,” drawled Ellen, one
foot upon the running-board. “You may count upon us!”
Her voice raised maliciously, she fastened her eyes upon
Anne’s windows.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the car swung around the driveway, Caldenas, a cherubic
smile upon his round face, leaned out recklessly. His
eyes were fixed ecstatically upon the house. “It is a gem,”
he was shouting lustily. “<i>Un pocito palacio.</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>An odd smile upon her face, Anne closed the window
softly. She envied the little Spaniard his absent-minded imperviousness.
What a boon! Would the gods had seen fit
to grant it to her also! With a shrug she went into the bathroom
and turned on the faucet behind the dolphin’s head.
Like a shower of gleaming crystal the water spouted on to
the tiles. Chilled to the marrow, a hot bath would send the
generous blood once more flowing in her congealed veins.
The steam encircled her, with its warm, comforting breath.
Her sheer nightgown fell around her feet like a discarded
sheath. She sank slowly into the frothing stream. It lapped
against her chin like the warm tongue of an affectionate dog.
As she went through the mechanical ritual, her thoughts
perused the events of the past night. It was sheer madness
for Alexis to have come to her door. Disregarding entirely
the danger from eavesdroppers, the action had been in atrocious
taste. Had he expected her to receive him as if nothing
had happened? The very idea was a degradation. It made
her feel soiled, ill at ease, galled with the entire situation.
He had shown no sense of delicacy whatsoever. And yet—was
she perhaps being a little hard on him? After all, he
was very young and very much in love? But he ought to
have known better, and she would have to teach him. She
stepped out of the bath and started to rub herself briskly.
The exhilarating glow of her blood coursed through her
comfortingly. Nevertheless, she decided to go home that very
morning, instead of waiting until the following day as she
had planned. After all, she was no longer in the mood to
stay. Her nerves were irritable, frayed. The fine ecstasy of
sacrifice entirely gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>She thrust her head deftly through the elliptical opening
of a négligée. It fell in caressing folds to her feet. An
underglow of turquoise chiffon showed against the sheer
black, through which her skin gleamed like alabaster. With
a feminine glance into the mirror, she reëntered the bedroom
and ordered her breakfast over the house wire. “Yes, please,
coffee, fruit and toast.” Her tones were briskly business-like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she slipped back into bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes later a clatter of dishes approached down
the hall, followed by a knock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come in,” called Anne languidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The door broke open unceremoniously and Alexis burst in
with the breakfast tray.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis!” Completely off her guard, Anne blushed
crimson.</p>

<p class='c008'>He pranced over to the table and deposited the tray upon
it. “‘<i>Enfin seuls!</i>’” His face was radiant. “Thank God,
they had rehearsals and had to rush off early.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know,” said Anne. “I watched them leave from
the window.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed excitedly. “Wouldn’t they have been furious
if they had guessed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But they did! I saw them looking up to my opened
windows and whispering.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat down upon the bed and falling upon her hands
covered them with kisses. “What do we care?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her laugh was angry. She happened to care a great deal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Insane boy, what possessed you to bring up my breakfast?
What will Jules think?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That you have a devoted cousin!” His joyous laugh rang
out again. He cupped her face in his long fingers and leaned
over her hotly. “What do we care what he thinks? He is
a good old soul, and well paid to keep his mouth shut.
Besides, after your sudden disappearance of last night, he
probably suspects the beautiful worst.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s face clouded. She drew away from the caressing
fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, probably, unless he’s a complete fool,” she commented
dryly. The tide of irritation flowed over her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis sensed her frigid mood. His face became suddenly
miserable. He went over to the table, picked up the tray and
laid it across her knees.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, dearest. Drink your coffee before it gets cold. Shall
I pour it for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, thank you.” She tipped the pot and the brown liquid
issued into the cup in a tubular stream. Its fragrance permeated
the room. “Alexis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, darling?” There was apprehension in his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sipped her coffee slowly. “I’ve decided to go back to
New York this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A dark flush tinted his pale cheeks. “So you are angry!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked over to the window and looked out upon the
whitened lawns. Her eyes followed him coldly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, I’m not angry, only shall we say, a little out of
mood?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned and faced her. He looked pitiful, an animal
at bay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Anne, is that reasonable? Is that fair? Was it my
fault last night? The intrusion was abominable and probably
premeditated. I loathed it as much as you. I did my best
to shield you, and, after all, they went away without discovering
anything, didn’t they?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her lips curled mockingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They may not have actually caught a glimpse of me in
the flesh, but their suspicions were practically confirmed.”
She bit savagely into a piece of toast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you are going to make me suffer?” He strode back
from the window and threw himself into a chair beside the
bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all. Only, as I said before, I’m no longer in the
mood to stay. Surely, I have the privilege of changing my
mind?” Putting aside the tray, she thrust her bare arms
behind her gleaming head. Her beauty was insolent. A
flame of desire, of hatred, and of anguish, scorched him. He
leaned forward and put his head in his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are cruel. I could almost hate you! Why do you
want to torture me? Wasn’t last night enough?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Last night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised his head and looked into her eyes. “Yes, last
night. When you refused to let me in I returned to my
room and threw myself upon the bed and lay there all night.
I went through hell. Unsatisfied, burning for you in every
fiber of my body. All the old madness, the dread, the fear,
came back upon me like a nightmare, and for a week, ever
since I saw you last, I had dreamed of something so different.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A gleam of pity crept into Anne’s eyes. She averted them
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You certainly did not expect me to receive you here with
those people in the house?” she said less coldly. “I could not
understand your coming to me that way. It offended me,
Alexis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you really loved me, you never would have thought
of that. You would have forgotten those others as quickly
as I did. The moment I left them in their rooms I thought
only of you, my Anne, my beautiful one. But even then I
waited for what seemed like an eternity.” He flung himself
upon his knees and buried his face in the coverlet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Anne, it never occurred to me that you would feel
that way. You had already given yourself to me, dearest,
and we had both so looked forward to being together in this
house. Our love was so hemmed in, so incomplete in New
York. This was to be our refuge, where we could enjoy a
security almost as wonderful as if we were married.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A smile twisted Anne’s lips into a downward curve. “It
was very secure, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be cruel. Last night was only an incident. It
won’t occur again. Not a soul except Rosenfield knows
where I am. He even forwards my mail.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder how Ellen discovered us, then? Is Rosenfield
bribeable?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not! Perhaps Karzimova’s press agent gave it
away. Any way, let’s forget it. I’m sure they would never
dare to come out again. You’re too valuable a friend for
Ellen to risk when her blood is cooled off!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His sudden astuteness amused her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps you are right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He pursued his advantage hastily. “We could be so
happy, if you would only let us. If you don’t love me I
simply don’t want to go on living. I was literally in hell
when you discovered me, I am your creature. Even my
music came back only because of you. And now you want
to destroy me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The little, wry smile once more curved her lips. She laid
her hand upon the rumpled head lying so close to her breast.
“You demand a great deal, my Alexis,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised his head and met her quizzical eyes proudly. “I
demand only what I supposed you were willing to give! If
you don’t want to stay I shall not keep you against your will.
I suppose I can go back to the devil again after all. I ought
to know the way!” he finished with boyish fury and despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne capitulated, with amusement and despair. Taking his
hand in hers, she pressed it softly. Her eyes were maternal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a baby you are, Alexis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are going to stay!” He sat down upon the bed and
fell upon her with ravenous kisses. His arms closed about her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I am going to stay,” she gasped, breathless from the
onslaught. She suddenly felt old and worn. Tired to the
core. Would he always wear down her resistance like this?
She pushed him away almost feebly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, will you let me get up, please? It is too
beautiful a day to remain in bed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to go out. I want to stay here,” he whispered,
his rebellious lips upon her neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little tremor thrilled through her tired body. “No,
Alexis, you don’t understand. Not in this room. Not here,”
she pleaded against his ear. “I—I can’t bear this room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Taken by surprise, he released her and regarded her in
dejected astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Anne, do you dislike it as much as all that? Does
it really make you unhappy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, darling, if I had only known that, I should never
have put you here. Of course, it’s a bit rococo, I admit, but
on the other hand, I didn’t feel any of the others were good
enough for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, they are.” She nodded with renewed vigor. “If
you want me to forget last night, give me another room,
Alexis. Something wholesome and simple. Free of associations
with Karzimova. Is there anything in the house like
that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her with reverence. Beneath each new leaf
that this woman unfolded her heart showed more undefiled.
Bursting with tenderness, he touched his lips to her hand like
a worshipper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course there is a room like that, dearest and best. A
room that will just suit you. Its walls are painted a soft
yellow. The chintzes are gay, and the sun pours in at the
windows all day long. With it goes a white tiled bathroom
of impeccable respectability.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They laughed gayly. She sat up and clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what I want. The chaste, white tiles of the great
American middle classes are good enough for me. I will get
up immediately and dress, and then you can help me move
my things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her with passionate protest. “Must you
dress?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course!” She slipped a slim white leg out of the bed
and pulled the sheer black negligee down over it quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the swiftness of a hawk, he swooped down upon her
foot and kissed it. His lips brushed across the curving instep,
the adorable little hollow of the arch. Then he placed it
upon his head with a flourish. “A slave passes beneath the
triumphal arch, oh Queen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop it this minute! You are tickling me, monster!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew her foot put of the curly hair with a slight
shiver, only to have him snatch it once more to his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes your heel so pink? Do you rouge it?” He
looked up at her with an impertinent grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>A twinkle in her eye, she shook her head vigorously. “Of
course not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it just natural for it to be so wonderful? And the
little toes so pink and cunning, too?” Her polished toe-nails
gleamed rosily up at him. He put on her black satin mule
lingeringly. “Now give me the other foot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held it out with a low laugh. “Same ceremony, lest
it should feel slighted!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you must go this minute,” she stood up and gave
him a little push.</p>

<p class='c008'>He adopted an injured air. “I’m going to stay and help
you dress.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No you’re not, my friend.” Her smile was determined.
“Out you go this moment.” Slipping her arm in his, she led
him to the door. His cheeks flushed hotly, he made a desperate
attempt to embrace her, but she eluded him nimbly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, bad one! I don’t intend to spend an exotic, temperamental
morning. I want to go out and take a walk or
something. The snow and the sunshine make me think of
the Engadine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sighed loudly, and then brightened. After all, Anne
was here, and she had promised to stay until to-morrow, at
least. It was hardly decent to hurry her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, we’ll do anything you wish. How would you
like to toboggan? There’s a splendid hill right here in the
grounds and I came upon an old sled in the basement the
other day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I should love that!” She clasped her hands with
genuine enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>He smiled delightedly. “And then there is an old inn, I
believe it was a mill once, where we might lunch or tea.
It is very out of the way and quite safe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That sounds very gay. Hurry up and go, dear. I just
can’t wait to toboggan. Do you suppose we’ll kill ourselves?”
She pushed him out into the hall and continued laughingly:
“I’ll leave my door open while I dress and you can play to
me, will you? You know you won’t have another chance to
practice to-day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Slave driver! Female Svengali!” he chuckled happily.
“Trilby hastens to obey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A few moments later the exquisite wail of the violin
drifted up the stairs. A contented smile upon her lips, Anne
slipped hastily into her lingerie. The joy of the creator
pulsed within her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day proved a huge success. Smooth as an uncrumpled
rose-leaf, it unfolded itself for the lovers without a hint of
the hectic jealousy, the frenzied bickering that Anne had
learned to dread. The hills were steep and possessed of a real
thrill. Their happy shrieks rang out as they tumbled over each
other on to the crisp, blue-shadowed snow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Followed a quiet lunch at home, ensparkled by a bubbling
old red wine, which Anne had brought on purpose from her
own cellar. Then a drive over glistening roads under the
snow-hung trees, after which they partook of tea at the
quaint, deserted old inn, where Anne extravagantly purchased
the entire stock of Spanish pottery and other useless, but
amusing trifles.</p>

<p class='c008'>After dinner, Alexis played and Anne accompanied him at
the piano. The music rose, a frenzied crescendo. It strung
their quivering senses higher and ever higher to a bliss almost
unbearable, a culmination of rapture that was pain. Their
souls blent in a single ecstasy. As the last quivering notes
died into silence, Anne rose from the piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is enough,” she whispered hoarsely. “I cannot bear
any more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis laid his violin in the case with his usual mechanical
care. He approached Anne slowly. Their glances mingled
like two fires. Extending their arms in a single gesture, they
melted against each other in a violent embrace.</p>

<p class='c008'>In her new chaste, little room, Anne undressed with trembling
fingers. The virginal panic which renewed itself at
each contact with Alexis seized upon her like a species of
stage-fright.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when he came, it vanished beneath the fervor of his
kisses.</p>

<p class='c008'>They shared a communion so perfect, an ecstasy so deep
that it resembled death. When they recovered from the
swoon, Alexis laid his head upon Anne’s shoulder like a
weary child.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to sleep with my head upon your breast. I want
to lie beside you all night, just as if we were married, just
as if I had the right,” he sobbed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne soothed him, as a woman soothes the child at her
breast, and presently he slept. But she lay awake beside him
for a long time, staring out into the moonlit night, savoring
her love, her compassion, her sacrifice.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The holiday season parted the lovers temporarily.
Alexis’ Christmas gift, a carved emerald, about her
neck, like a symbol of slavery, Anne went to Virginia to
visit her aunt. She was gone two weeks and the change did
her good. An invalid, her aunt saw almost no one, and the
blessed sunny monotony of the days fell like balm upon
Anne’s irked spirit. Wrapped in rugs, for the air was keen,
she sat with the old lady in the frost-touched garden and
read aloud to her from gentle, time-worn books, which they
both loved. Stevenson and Thackeray, and once or twice
Jane Austen. Or, if they felt particularly devilish, Bourget,
or even Prévost. Well-bred salacities, as mild and unfleshly
as a Watteau screen. Meanwhile, Anne’s soul basked in the
radiant peace.</p>

<p class='c008'>The winter had not proved an easy one, so far, and as the
time approached for Alexis’ concert, Anne welcomed his
increased absorption. His accompanist, Paul Leon, spent the
greater part of the week at the house in Long Island, leaving
Saturdays and Sundays as the only free days, and the greater
part of these were spent either in practicing, or in talking over
with Anne the programs for his coming season. Following
his recital in Carnegie Hall, at the end of January, there were
to be several appearances with different orchestras, including
the Philharmonic. After that the projected tour of the principal
cities would come. All this required a very careful and
varied choice of program. And Alexis was both painstaking
and meticulous. As he was temperamental as well, it naturally
followed that he often changed his mind. One day, a
Tchaikowsky Concerto would obsess him to the point of
rapture. The next he would develop a Beethoven complex.
Some waltz of Wienawski, a serenade of Kreisler would fling
him into Paradise for a week. The Serenade Melancolique
rode him for days like a subconscious sorrow. He would get
out of bed, and still half asleep, take out his violin and play it
until exhaustion overcame him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is the song of a fallen angel,” he cried one night, tears
falling down his working face. “The agony of lost glory,
the utter hopelessness are all there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her own eyes overflowing, Anne pillowed his head on her
shoulder, and murmured comfort until he fell into a sorrowful
slumber. Frequently she lay awake beside him for hours.
These days filled with a continuous wave of sound, left her
storm-tossed and weary. Fragments of concertos thundered
through her tired brain. Mingled with a sonata, the piercing
sweetness of a Berçeuse; the monotonous, but beautiful precision
of an exercise, until her head hummed like the inside
of a seashell, and her spirit felt as void. She envied Alexis
his ability to throw off a mood at will. To forget the labors
of the day in the transports of the night. And yet it was
this very quality which she dreaded. After hours of planning
programs and listening to excerpts from problematical choices,
she was expected to play the <i>grande amoureuse</i>, to respond
with ardor to Alexis’ quenchless thirst. If Anne’s embraces
were tepid, her smile a little absent, her echoing and aching
head was heaped with reproaches. She did not love him any
more. She never had loved him. She was fickle as the new
moon, and as cold. She was thinking of marrying some one
else. Yes, yes, that must be it. Who was it? That snobbish
fool of a Gerald Boynton, who thought he could play
the piano? (The cheek of these amateurs was amusing.) Or
that Marchese, of whom Ellen was constantly hinting? Why
didn’t she tell him and put him out of his agony immediately?
She knew he was not able to marry her, himself. He was
tied hand and foot to a fond fool, who would not give him
his freedom. Yes, but he would take it just the same, this
precious freedom, if it tore Claire into little pieces, to wrest
it from her! And so on, sometimes for an hour. Until
Anne’s nerves shrieked for peace, and her tongue was numb
from reiterated denials. Until exhausted, Alexis would
cease as suddenly as he had begun, and laying his head
upon her knees, beg for the forgiveness which was so ungrudgingly
granted. The humility of his joy always aroused
Anne’s compassion. Heavy with fatigue, sorrowful for his
shame, she would allow Alexis to have his way.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not strange that Anne welcomed the peace of her
aunt’s Southern household, and basked wistfully within its
sunny garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet her memories, of course, were not all irksome.
There had been hours of splendid companionship, moments
of exquisite communion, and it was upon these that her
thoughts preferred to dwell. Alexis absent was so much
more comfortable than in the flesh. Safe from his fatiguing
intensity, Anne wondered how she ever could have taken
his moods so seriously. And his letters were so pathetic.
Incoherent, ridiculously young, they poured forth an incense
of supplication that was lyrical and even beautiful. Almost
biblically flowery, Anne called them her ‘Songs of Alexis,’
and laughed softly over their pages.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, the situation was becoming more difficult to
handle every day. Alexis’ passion, increased by possession,
tantalized by infrequent and stolen meetings, had become an
obsession both rapturous and tragic. The thought that he had
no claim upon Anne beyond that of tenderness, tortured
him. Although he was careful not to mention it to her as a
definite fact, Anne felt that he was doing all in his power to
bring about an annulment of his marriage to Claire, and she
secretly hoped that he would be unsuccessful. At his vague
hints, she always laughed and told him she was not a marrying
woman. That if he wanted a wife, he must look elsewhere.
But she could see that it made almost no impression upon him
at all. He desired their union so ardently himself that it was
impossible for him to believe that Anne could refuse to marry
him, once he were free. He even went so far as to depict
their future life in terms both ecstatic and impractical. A
patient smile upon her lips, Anne would shudder inwardly.
She had neither the desire nor the intention of becoming
Alexis’ wife. There were almost ten years between their
ages and she could imagine nothing more tragic, nor more
difficult, than to be the elderly wife of a young genius. It
would take endless courage to live up to his exactions, to
respond to his demand. She would have to be eternally beautiful,
a very river of sympathy and understanding, upon whose
bosom he could float in perfect serenity and peace. In other
words, mother as well as companion, not to mention accompanist,
fellow traveler, and perfect hostess. If she were
sufficiently unfortunate to continue to love him, there would
be scores of other women to combat, especially after the first
glamour had worn off, and he had commenced to realize the
difference in their ages. Even now, when he was supposedly
in retirement, he received countless letters from hysterical
women and girls, endless demands for interviews and photographs,
which kept his newly-acquired secretary occupied most
of the day. No, marriage with Alexis would not only be
unspeakably wearing, but very probably spell tragedy for them
both.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, there were precious moments to be garnered.</p>

<p class='c008'>With renewed serenity and rested nerves, she bade farewell
to the gentle little aunt, who would probably have succumbed
if she had suspected to what Anne was returning. Reluctantly,
but with suppressed excitement, Anne wended her way
northwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were only ten days left before the first recital, and
she found Alexis more engrossed in his work than ever. Her
little absence had in some measure restored his former independence.
Almost automatically, the situation adjusted itself.
They saw less and less of each other, meeting sometimes for
lunch, sometimes for tea at a quiet restaurant. Anne made
only one trip to Long Island. She found Alexis absent-minded,
more erratic than ever. His eyes, brilliantly hard,
seemed to be focussed entirely upon the future. His manner
toward herself was less apologetic, more assured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne took up her customary life with indifference. Seeing
as little as possible of Ellen and her friends, she treated the
former with a cold cordiality which if not an actual declaration
of war, constituted a challenge. Gerald Boynton frequented
the house as usual, however. A tame cat is a great
convenience to a woman like Anne. A necessary escort, he
was at her beck and call at all moments, to secure theater
tickets, and even to run errands. Caldenas came to see her
once or twice, and Anne found herself liking him well
enough to promise to sit for her portrait.</p>

<p class='c008'>But all this was merely artificial, a stuffing of cotton into
the void of time. Weary of New York as never before,
Anne longed for her villa in Florence, her sun-baked terrace,
the pungent smell of the black earth awakening in anticipation
of spring. Nothing but Alexis and his need could have
kept her in New York another day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, when the New York concerts would be over, and
Alexis had gone on tour, she, too, would flit. Then he could
follow her if he desired, and they might meet somewhere on
the Continent. But not in Florence. No, not there, where
her memories were all of Vittorio. She could not receive
Alexis within a stone’s throw of Vittorio’s mother, that beautiful
old lady, who had so often joined her pleas to his.
Indeed, she could not find it in her heart to return to Florence
at all, if it were not that she was so sure that Vittorio would
be in Sicily. Ah, Vittorio! There was a man, if you please!
A <i>Grand Seigneur</i>, and yet a worker. One of the best.
Where was he now? Still in Mexico digging up Aztec relics,
or had the ocean already separated them?</p>

<p class='c008'>Arrived here, Anne would sigh and push the rebellious
thought back into her teeming subconscious, much as a careless
housemaid sweeps undesirables beneath the bed. By her
own action, she had closed the door between Vittorio and all
of his forever. Was she not above peeking through the
keyhole?</p>

<p class='c008'>She fixed her eyes resolutely upon the actualities of the
present.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />TRIUMPH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Carnegie Hall gaped before Anne’s eyes, like the
yawning jaws of some prehistoric monster. Knees
quaking beneath her, she seated herself in the front of the
box and motioned to her two companions to do likewise.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crimson of excitement on her cheeks, emphasizing her
creamy pallor, she rose from her sheath of almond-green
velvet like a flame-crowned flower upon its stem. A cluster
of gardenias fastened upon one shoulder, nestled against the
warmer tints of her flesh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, confess that you are nervous as the devil,” giggled
Gerald, slipping into a seat behind her. “You look more like
an American beauty than the gardenias you affect of late.”
He glanced jealously at the flowers she was wearing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her flush deepened. Gardenias were Alexis’ favorite
flower and he sent them to her daily. If she failed to wear
them he was heart-broken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is natural for <i>Madame</i> to be nervous to-night.”
Caldenas interposed his plump person soothingly. “Mr.
Petrovskey is her friend, is he not? And in a sense her
<i>protégé</i>. It is only human to be a little excited now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne forced a grateful smile. But his reminder had
increased her apprehension to the point of terror.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she looked over the packed house she shuddered involuntarily.
Before just such an audience as this had Alexis failed,
an eager, anticipatory audience, filling every seat, overflowing
into the foyer, into a standing mob. Only then it had been as
soloist with the Philharmonic. To-night he was alone, unsupported
except by his accompanist. And he had chosen to
begin his recital with the very concerto upon which he had
broken down, that haunting, melodious, most sensuous of
concertos by Lalo, known as the Spanish. True, he had
played it magnificently before her many times in the last few
weeks. But she had always recoiled with instinctive superstition
as his audacity in repeating it upon his very first reappearance
before the public. Alexis had laughed at her fear
scornfully. Without the concerto, his triumph would be only
half a triumph, an admission of weakness, both to himself
and to the public, and a very poor tribute to Anne who had
given him back to the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she recalled these words, she clenched her icy hands.
A thrill of exultation coursed through her stage-fright. Yes,
she was giving Alexis Petrovskey back to the world. Would
the gift prove worthy?</p>

<p class='c008'>But meanwhile there was a heightened stir in the audience;
a rising murmur as of new-born and rushing wind in a dense
forest. The next moment, volcanic applause shook the house.
Applause full of enthusiasm and tribute, containing an undercurrent
of sympathy which filled Anne’s eyes with a mist of
tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis and his accompanist had come on to the stage, and
the American public was evincing not only its love of art,
but its unconquerable tenderness of heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the mist of tears, Anne caught the brilliant gleam
of Alexis’ eyes, as they eagerly sought her own. Now he
was bowing to the vociferous house. Looking swiftly towards
Anne’s box, he repeated his bow. The personal intent was
unmistakable. As he turned to take the key from Paul Leon,
a veritable battalion of opera-glasses was leveled upon Anne
and her companions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Faintness dragged her momentarily beneath the waves of
consciousness. Her soul shrank within her. The picture of
their entire intimacy from the first meeting in the hut to the
present moment of exquisite apprehension flashed before her
like a vision of the drowning. When she came to, the house
lay silent beneath the first notes of the concerto.</p>

<p class='c008'>All Anne’s fear had been for nothing. Alexis was playing
as she had never heard him play before. The golden notes
lingered upon the air, round with substance, light as a sunbeam
dancing upon the wall. They soared toward the sky
like iridescent birds, then swooped earthwards with the beat
of celestial wings. Motionless, the life concentrated in his
eyes and the rhythm of his bow, his chin caressing his violin
as if it were a human thing, Alexis played with all the fire,
the eloquence of a modern Orpheus waiting at the gates of
Hades. His features slightly haggard from emotion and
over-work, were Greek. The slim body as full of grace as
the faun of Praxiteles. The drooping lids seemed to conceal
a very fury of genius and inspiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The end of the first movement was met with clamorous
applause. Staid old Carnegie Hall pulled its one foot out of
the grave and donned the enthusiasm of youth. Nerves relaxed
in happy abandon, Anne leaned back in her chair. A
flood of joyous relief swept over her from head to foot. Yes,
it had not been in vain. Alexis was truly great. She felt
herself a creator. At last there was a reason for her having
been born.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Alexis flung himself into the next movement, she awakened
to the house about her. She glanced at the nearest boxes
and had a glimpse of Ellen and Olive, surrounded by black
coats and gleaming shirt-fronts. Meeting Ellen’s eyes, she
nodded gayly, then swept her opera-glasses across the house.
A familiar face, surmounting a large and unwieldy body,
caught her glance. It was Mme. Petrovskey. Although they
had only met once, Anne would never forget that bland,
doll-like countenance, with its cruelly undoll-like eyes. With an
imperceptible shudder, she dropped her glasses into her lap.
Mme. Petrovskey was unaccompanied by Claire. Was the
girl ill? Or was it her own, Anne’s, presence which had kept
her away? A familiar sensation of guilt overwhelmed her.
She felt like a child-murderer, a trampler upon flowers. She
had helped to ruin Claire’s life. An involuntary instrument
of torture, the gods had manipulated her to the accompaniment
of ironic laughter. The useless, the senseless tragedy
of it all! If Alexis had only loved Claire, how different it
would have been for them all. And yet would she, Anne,
change it if she could? Would she be willing to relinquish
into Claire’s feeble fingers the rapturous moments of the last
few months, this present triumph? She believed she would.
But who knows, least of all himself, what tenacious devil of
jealousy and lust may not be lurking within his own subconscious
fastness?</p>

<p class='c008'>Leveling inscrutable eyes upon Mme. Petrovskey, she caught
a return flash from the babyish blue orbs. They both bowed
constrainedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>From her refuge in the back row, Claire grasped Dr.
Elliott’s arm. Her gaze, never long withdrawn from Anne’s
box, had intercepted the bow between the two women on
opposite sides of the house. Her cheeks, hitherto pale, flamed
crimson.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man beside her cursed inwardly. As he had feared,
the whole thing was proving too much for the poor child.
He was glad that he had insisted upon accompanying her. It
would have been abominable to have permitted her to come
alone. She ought not to be here as it was. The glamour of
Petrovskey’s music was sufficient to unnerve her, let alone his
triumph. As the magic notes floated out upon the air in a
very fury of perfection, Claire’s companion wondered no
longer at the hold that the player had obtained over her. He
was just the sort of man that a woman would fall for. And
having fallen, remain prostrate to be trampled upon at his
will. And the creature had charm (damned if he hadn’t) a
sort of melancholy charm—the charm that conceals discrepancies
as a tropical vine flowers about a rotten stump. No, he
did not blame Claire for being infatuated with the fellow.
Settling back into his seat, he sighed resignedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The concerto ended upon a dramatic silence. It seemed as
if the whole world were holding its breath. Then a storm of
applause broke out. With a shock, shattering as thunder,
rhythmic as the roll of gigantic drums, Alexis was recalled
over and over again. Upon one of his returns a woman in
the front row threw her bunch of violets on to the stage.
They dropped at Alexis’ feet. He stooped, and picking them
up, pressed them to his lips. The applause rose to a deafening
crescendo. Cries of “bravo” punctuated the clamor shrilly.
With a smile, Alexis placed the violets upon the piano, where
he characteristically forgot them.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Alexis made his last exit before the intermission, Dr.
Elliott turned towards Claire. About to express enthusiastic,
if unwilling praise of the performance, he stopped short at
sight of her face. The small features were convulsed into a
mask of agony. She was weeping softly, weakly, as if her
very blood were seeping out with her tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must let me take you home at once,” he exclaimed
under the general uproar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without a protest she followed him out into the aisle,
“Yes,” she whispered, “I didn’t think that I would disgrace
myself like this. I suppose I ought to have taken your advice
and not come. But oh, I wanted to so much. I was so
afraid for him, you know. I had a silly feeling that my love
might help him, even if he didn’t care or know that I was
there!” She sobbed beneath her breath. “But I see he didn’t
need me after all,” she added, as they fought their way out
into the lobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s impressions of the intermission were hazy. Barely
conscious of the inroad of visitors upon her box, she answered
their sallies with the mechanical ease of long habit. To Ellen’s
repeated pleas that she should come down to MacDougal Alley
and play poker after the concert, she was amiably curt. She
had a headache. Ellen knew she detested cards. If Ellen
suspected a reason for Anne’s refusal, she gave no hint. But
her eyes rested upon the emerald pendant maliciously. She
is going to meet him afterwards, she mused.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last half of the program met with as vociferous an
approval. The Préludium and Allegro of Pugnani, a serenade
by Kreisler, some of Brahm’s Hungarian Dances were
played as only a few can play them. A sonata of Schumann
breathed exquisite tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the concert was over, there was a clamor for encores.
Pale, but exultant, Alexis was generous, and gave of his best.
Laughing, dancing tunes, that sent everybody home happy.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the last notes of a Wienawski waltz died away, he left
the stage for the last time and the audience rose <i>en masse</i> and
made for the exit. A chattering, excited throng, Anne
regarded it through grateful tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, shall we go? Or do you intend to spend all night
in the sanctuary?” Gerald held out Anne’s chinchilla cape
with a mocking glance. “Did the little tin god perform
satisfactorily, or was she disappointed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She slipped into her cape with a nonchalant air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The little tin god is solid gold all the way through, I’m
inclined to believe. But as he has descended from the altar,
we might as well move along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you are not coming to MacDougal Alley, may I not
see you home, Madame?” Caldenas bowed like a dignified
cherub.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, thank you, Caldenas, please don’t trouble. After
music like this I prefer to be alone. I’m sure you understand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stepped to the railing and picked up her gloves and her
opera glasses. As she did so, her eyes swept absently over the
dispersing crowd and lighted upon a tall man almost directly
beneath her. Something familiar about the cut of his head,
the slope of his broad shoulders, penetrated her to the core.
She leaned over the railing in sudden apprehension. As if in
response, the man turned and their glances flamed to a focus.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a confusion at once sickening and sweet, Anne found
herself looking into the eyes of Vittorio Torrigiani. For a
second, she felt as if all the blood in her body had seeped to
her heart. Then it poured back in a crimson stream from her
feet to the roots of her hair. An instinctive desire for flight
overcame her. She turned and made for the back of the box,
where Gerald was patiently waiting. Vittorio, how ghastly!
How could she ever face him? And yet after that flaming
interchange of glances, how could she let him go? She
returned to the railing and called after the retreating figure
softly. From the back of the box Gerald watched her in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vittorio?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later and he stood within the box. He took her
icy fingers in his and pressed them to his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had not intended to have you see me,” he said quietly.
“Please don’t think that I meant to intrude, <i>cara</i>. Only as I
was passing by Carnegie Hall I saw the announcement of the
concert. I couldn’t resist coming in, and perhaps catching
a farewell glimpse of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A farewell glimpse?” Her voice faltered. He looked
down at her longingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I am sailing for Sicily in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So soon! Without even letting me know! How long
have you been in New York?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I arrived from Mexico this morning. I didn’t think you
would want to see me, <i>cara</i>. That is why I didn’t let you
know. Besides—there are some things a man cannot bear,”
he added beneath his breath so that Gerald wouldn’t hear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vittorio!” Her whisper was broken. “I must see you
before you go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His downcast face suddenly became eager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I go home with you now, then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The crimson stain filtered back into her pale cheeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Vittorio. I’m afraid not. I—shall not be free,”
she finished with a little agonized rush.</p>

<p class='c008'>The new radiance drained from his face as suddenly as
it had come.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we shall have to wait for another trip. Until you
come to Florence perhaps?” Repressed suffering harshened
his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Humiliated to the point of anguish, she was about to
acquiesce, when she encountered his tragic eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why can’t you drive home with me? We will take a
turn about the park and have a little talk. I—I have a
message for your mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His features relaxed a trifle. “Not the message she is
hoping for, I fear,” he sighed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the corridor behind the box he greeted Gerald, who had
retired there with unusual tact.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I warn you, I’m eloping with the Marchese,” laughed
Anne nervously. “He is sailing in the morning and it is our
only chance for a chat. We’re going for a turn around the
park. Isn’t it devilish of us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Devilish selfish,” Gerald’s laugh rang forced. He followed
them out into the lobby with sulky dignity.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they threaded their way through the dwindling crowd
upon the sidewalk, Anne met the imperturbable stare of a pair
of China-blue eyes. A basilisk stare that fastened itself upon
them as she and Vittorio entered her motor and drove away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />ANTI-CLIMAX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After Anne dropped Vittorio at his hotel blankness fell
upon her; the limitless blankness of a solitary planet
whirling in space. A loneliness devastating as the fear of
death. What a strange, uncompanioned thing the soul was.
How horribly alone. How impossible for it to merge with
another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a weeping woman, Anne was conscious of an intolerable
ache in her throat, an intolerable emptiness in the heart.
She and Vittorio had parted once again, and this time it had
hurt, as if her very flesh had been riven apart. And yet, so
alone is the soul, so dumb in its self-expression, that the short
drive had appeared neither tragic nor momentous. Merely
unfruitful and incomplete.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>malaise</i> had lain upon them from the very beginning.
A creeping paralysis had bound their tongues to trivialities,
their souls to silence and constraint. And yet Anne felt as if
neither of them would ever forget this night. Nor how
beautiful the park had looked, like a scene in a Russian opera,
with the snow blossoming upon the trees like gigantic flowers.
Skyscrapers, luminous against the heavens, impregnable castles
of supermen, had flung a challenge into space. Their diamond-studded
windows were more brilliant than the stars.</p>

<p class='c008'>But inside the car it had been warm, even cozy. Vittorio’s
shoulder had brushed against hers. His profile only half
visible, had leaned towards her. The scent of his cigarettes
still lingered upon the air with a hint of comfort. She
stretched out her hand and touched the place where he had
sat. It was still warm. Some of his vitality remained as if
to console her. He had actually sat there a few moments ago
in the flesh. And now there was only a vague hint of
warmth,—and emptiness. How could a thing be one moment,
and yet not only vanish the next, but even seem as if it had
never existed? Was it possible that nothing was real, after
all? How strange a thing is the fluidity of time. The past
flowed into the present. The present welled into the future,
and swept onwards like a mighty river, towards the ocean of
eternity, whence came its source. Encircling the globe in its
rushing current, it carried one upon its bosom, helpless but
protesting from the vast gray sea of birth to the vast gray
sea of death, which in the end are one and the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>What a mystery it all was, a problem. Heavy with weariness,
Anne’s smile showed drearily from beneath a passing
arc light. Protest, rebellion? What was the use of either,
if one were only a leaf upon the swirl of heavy waters? To
stay the flow for the fraction of a second was an impossibility
denied even to the gods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Things were like that. A little while ago she and Vittorio
had sat here, side by side, and uttered trivialities. The moment
was gone forever and he with it. Carried upon it as
if by a substance more powerful than flesh and blood. And
now that he was no longer there, that he no longer existed
In time, it seemed, she could think of a thousand things that
they might have said to each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>As it was, she scarcely remembered that they had exchanged
more than a few phrases. Yet of course that could have been
hardly possible. She recalled asking him how he had enjoyed
his stay in Mexico, and scarcely listening for the reply. She
had a vague impression that he had found it interesting. He
had spoken at some length about a friend of his, a Spaniard,
whose diggings he had visited near Mexico City, where the
remains of an ancient civilization, entirely concealed by lava,
were in the process of discovery. Bodies had been found,
almost perfectly preserved in the positions in which the fiery
death had caught them. The very utensils in their hands were
unbroken. Some of the bodies were being placed in glass
cases, to be exhibited in the Museum in Mexico City. Anne
had laughed foolishly at this point, making some banal remark
about how embarrassing it must have been for the poor
creatures, as if one were caught with one’s hair in curl-papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>But her ridiculous laughter had helped, if only momentarily,
to break through the crust of constraint which lay upon
them both like the coating of lava upon the little city he was
telling her of. Vittorio had turned to her abruptly, and asked
if she were happy. The tremor in his voice had startled her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is any one ever happy?” she had evaded.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he had insisted upon knowing the truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For God’s sake, tell me Anne. It can’t hurt me half as
much as to feel that you are suffering or have made a
frightful mistake. I don’t think I could quite bear that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose I am happy,” her reply had been somewhat
uncertain. “I didn’t expect to be happy, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But her answer had not pleased him. Perhaps he had considered
it both priggish and insincere. For his voice was
incredulous and slightly mocking as he had proceeded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Anne, admit it. You are madly in love with him?
What woman wouldn’t be? He is a genius. This evening
proved that if nothing else. As I listened to him, chills
coursed up my spine. Chills of admiration, and yes, I might
as well own up to it, chills of hatred and of jealousy. I am
a man, and I suffered. He is too beautiful, Anne. He
reminds me of a small statuette I once dug up near Messina,
and which was since destroyed in the earthquake. Of course
you love him, Anne. It goes without saying. And I prefer
to have you honest about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His tone had both distressed and annoyed her. Why did
men always take things for granted? Even Vittorio, who
had known her for the last ten years could not seem to understand
the many-faceted urge which impelled her actions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Vittorio, I don’t think I do love him,” she had remonstrated
patiently. “That is, I’m not in love with him. He is
really more like a child than a man in some ways. A fascinating,
precocious child, of course, but sometimes a very
naughty one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she was sorry to have admitted so much, for she
sensed that her words had resounded upon Vittorio’s heart
like a blow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that he’s not good to me,” she hastened to add, impelled
by pride and pity. “A bit difficult at times, because
he knows that he cannot make me his wife. But I don’t
really mind. For I’m so sorry for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The rest of the drive had proceeded in stark silence, punctuated
at intervals by those scattered inanities by which one
strives to cover the nakedness of the soul.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he sat beside her to-night, Anne surmised the torture
that Vittorio had undergone. Her knowledge of his character
was founded upon years of comradeship. A proud man, it
must have been sheer agony for him to realize her anomalous
position. To feel that she had been content to take second
best when he had offered her his all so many times and been
rejected. And yet although it was inevitable that he should
suffer, not once had he made her feel any lessening of his
respect, or even of his love. He had understood so much
better than most men the impulse of pity that lay back of her
surrender. He had seemed to comprehend, too, the temporal
quality of it all. Anne knew that if she would leave Alexis
and go to Vittorio some day he would not only consider her
as unsmirched as before, but possibly better for the experience.
He was unique among men in that he realized the sacrificial
quality of her action. The only thing that he would not
forgive would be hypocrisy. Of that she was aware, to her
despair. For it was this very thing that had severed them like
a sword when they parted. Vittorio believed that out of some
motive of pity, and possibly of modesty, Anne was deceiving
him about her feeling for Alexis. She knew he believed
this and yet she was as powerless to undeceive him as she was
to take up the imaginary sword that lay between them and
thrust it into her living breast. Oh, why had she not obeyed
her instinct for flight, and avoided this perilous encounter?
What a tragedy of errors they had all drifted into. What a
farce it was. A trick of the ironical gods who dig colossal
fingers into one’s ribs and expect one to laugh like a babe
being tickled. Why had Vittorio returned to-night of all
nights? To-night when she had been riding upon the pinnacle?
Why had their eyes encountered in that shattering
glance, which had flung her once more into the abyss of
doubt and fear? She had felt so exultant in Alexis’ triumph.
So eager to pour renewed radiance upon his victory and his
fatigue. And now the desire had completely departed, sucked
into the mud of anti-climax.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this mood was not only foolish, but dangerous. To-night
was big with significance. She must retain the glamor
at all costs. To-night belonged to Alexis. It was his triumph
and re-entry into his birthright. Upon it, his genius had
emerged, new-born and greater than ever before, as if in
temporary recoil it had acquired impetus. Yes, to-night was
Alexis’ and hers, for was it not her love that had re-created
him? Was not his inspiration begotten of their passion as
truly as if it had been a child of flesh and blood? No, Alexis
must never suspect the still-born quality of her joy. Nor that
she was relying upon his living blaze to rekindle her own
flame.</p>

<p class='c008'>To-night had a special significance too, in the fact that she
was permitting him to come to her in her own house for the
first time since they had become lovers. Fear that the servants,
those ancient slave-drivers of convention, might talk,
had hitherto rendered her cautious. But this was a special
occasion for which she had decided to break all rules. It
would have been intolerable not to have rejoiced together
to-night. And sacrilege to have done so in public. Even now
she had been discreet and arranged for most of her household
to be out. Regina alone, had prepared the little supper,
which was to be served before the fire in the upstairs sitting-room.
Regina, who would have returned from the concert
herself, and who had probably shed tears of joy over Alexis’
triumph. Dear old Regina of the keen eyes and wise heart,
who, suspecting all, had never let fall a hint or a reproach.
Poor Regina, who had not permitted herself to speak of the
Marchese since his departure, and whose plucky spirit was,
as Anne knew, heavy with nostalgia for Florence and the
beloved villa.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />DISSONANCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The car had turned an abrupt corner and stopped before
the house. Regina opened the door, a metamorphosed
Regina clad in concert regalia, very respectable and solid.
Upon her face an expression of exaltation was overlaid by
one of anxiety. Anne attributed the exaltation to the concert.
Regina had all the Latin’s adoration for music. But the
anxiety was somewhat puzzling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has Mr. Petrovskey arrived?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Regina nodded. The black brows knitted themselves above
troubled eyes. “He awaits in the sitting-room, <i>Signora</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Something was very much the matter. Had Alexis been
snubbing the poor old dear? Anne assumed a gay nonchalance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, was it not a concert after your own heart, Regina?
A triumph and a marvel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman raised knotted hands to heaven. “He is an
angel, <i>Signora</i>! Inspired by the <i>Madonna</i> and all the saints.
He could melt the heart of the devil himself, not to speak of
poor old Regina!” Her face fell suddenly. “After a <i>trionfo</i>
like that, he should be gay as the bird. But he is not, <i>Signora
mia</i>. He walk up the stairs with a face like one black cloud.
He never say a word to poor Regina!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is tired. You must excuse him. He is usually so
nice to you, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, <i>si</i>, <i>si</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne proceeded slowly up the stairs. So she would have to
cope with a mood! Ennui surged over her. In that moment
she understood fully the weary distaste of a man who has to
deal with a hysterical woman. Oh, why was Alexis so temperamental?
She shrugged, and turning the knob of the
sitting room door, entered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Apparently unoccupied, the only light came from the cheerful
fire which chuckling upon the hearth like a contented hen,
lent an amber glow to the paneled walls where Sargent’s
portrait of Anne’s mother smiled gently in its antiquated garb.
Anne pressed her finger on the electric button by the door.
A golden stream flooded the shadowy corners. Upon a sofa
at the extreme end of the room lay Alexis. At her approach,
he drew an audible, almost sobbing breath, and sat up and
faced her. The thick hair rumpled into a comb over knotted
brows, his eyes were somber.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where have you been? I thought you would never
come!” He walked swiftly towards her.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Anne heard the stricken note in his voice, her heart
melted into a pool of tears. She ran forward and encircled
him with her arms, as one would a sorrowful child.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t think you would be here so soon,” she exclaimed
contritely. “I imagined there would be a swarm of people
waiting to fall upon you with congratulations. Was I
wrong?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He trembled beneath her hold. She released him with a
weary little sigh. Her doubt had evidently ruffled his vanity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course there was a crowd. But I only spoke to a few
personal friends, and one or two reporters. Rosenfield told
the rest I was too exhausted to speak to them, which, was a
lie, God knows, for I never felt less tired in all my life.
You see, I was thinking of you and this meeting.” He
laughed loudly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She ignored his angry eyes with a feeling of guilt. “But
Alexis, what a triumph! How proud you have made me!”
She caressed his shoulders with gentle hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>He flung himself from her hold. “Then why, if you are
so proud and happy, have you kept me waiting while you go
motoring with another man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A milk-white pallor overspread Anne’s cheeks. She flung
off her coat and seated herself before the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So that is what is the matter?” In the glow of the flames
her hair encircled her face like a brazen nimbus. Alabaster
skin shone luminous against the opaque white of the gardenias
upon her shoulder. Alexis’ gaze bit into her beauty angrily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t that enough? Isn’t it enough that you should leave
me to-night for another man? To-night which was mine by
right? Desert me for a stranger at the very doors of Carnegie
Hall?” The clenched hands became livid.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Alexis, give me a chance to explain. It was all an
accident. Entirely unpremeditated.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An accident! I shouldn’t call it exactly that! Who was
this man with whom a <i>tête-à-tête</i> was so necessary that you
couldn’t wait until to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was the <i>Marchese</i> Torrigiani, since you ask. I would
have told you before if your torrential abuse had permitted.”
She replied quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I thought he was in Italy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So he will be in another week. He is sailing to-morrow.”
The regret in her tone angered Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what is he doing in New York again? Or has he
been here all the time?” He inquired with quick suspicion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not in the habit of lying, Alexis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her composure frightened him. He threw out his arms
in a beseeching gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have pity on me, Anne. I don’t mean to hurt you. But
I’m so unhappy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cold light died out of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s nothing to be so miserable about, Alexis. Torrigiani
has been in Mexico all this time. He merely stopped
on his way back to Italy. He hadn’t even let me know that
he was here. He happened to be passing by Carnegie Hall
to-night and saw the notices of your concert. Our meeting
was entirely accidental, and nothing to torture yourself about.
As it seemed to be our only chance for a talk, I drove him
around the park and left him at his hotel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He flung himself at her feet in his customary gesture of
penitence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Anne, forgive me if I seem cruel and suspicious.
But are you in love with this man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laid her hand on the tumbled fair hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, dear, of course not. But I do care for and respect
him almost more than any one I know. No one, not even you
could ever come between us, and I don’t want you to try.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her with tragedy-ridden eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have a terrible premonition that you are going to marry
Torrigiani some time, and I am ready to kill him when I
think of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t commit any murders as yet!” Her laugh sounded
forced. “I am not going to marry him or any other man,
yourself included!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rose to his feet with the cry of a wounded animal.
“You do love him. You cannot hide it from me any longer,
Anne. As soon as I leave New York you are going to Italy
to meet him. Deny it if you can!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I’m going to Italy, Alexis. There could be
nothing to keep me here after you go. I am homesick for
Florence and my garden. But I’m not going there to meet
Vittorio.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, you are. And you are afraid to tell me for fear my
music will suffer. But it won’t. Nothing can ever take it
from me now. Least of all a woman’s whim!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A grim smile sketched itself upon Anne’s lips. Alexis’
temper she had borne with before. But his ingratitude was
new, and wounded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I’m not necessary to you, perhaps it is just as well that
we are separating so soon!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I was right, after all!” he exclaimed with a certain
tragic satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>She determined to punish him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps, who knows? Life with Vittorio would at least
be peaceful. He is neither temperamental nor a genius. Just
a mere man who believes in me. His bruised feelings wouldn’t
have to be perpetually coddled!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If that is the way you feel about me, Anne, I had better
go!” Beads of moisture about his temples, Alexis made for
the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>She followed him, and drew him back into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be silly, dearest. You know I don’t want you to go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He wheeled in her arms, and kissed her with tragic passion.
His face was wet with tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Anne, if I should lose you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You won’t, poor dear, you won’t!” she cried brokenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew him down on to the chaise-longue beside her. He
laid his head upon her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Torrigiani will not be in Florence,” she explained, leaning
her cheek against the thick, soft hair. “He expects to go
direct to Sicily. If he were to be there I should not want
to go. It would be too humiliating.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does he know? Have you told him about us?” There
was a throb of incredulous joy in Alexis’ voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.” Her head drooped beneath the crimson stain that
surged up to her forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Anne, can you ever forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dear. Only don’t try me too often. Just take me
for granted sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I mean to, God knows. Only I’m so afraid of losing
you. There are so many men in your life. And I am tied.”
She laid commanding fingers upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That subject is taboo! Don’t you dare bring it up again!
But tell me how did you know about Torrigiani!” she inquired
with a certain curiosity. Had the probing blue orbs
belonged to Mme. Petrovskey after all?</p>

<p class='c008'>“My mother told me,” he replied simply. “She saw you
go out together. She came behind to see me afterward. However,
I scarcely believed her. I thought she must have mistaken
some one else for you. She had only seen you once, you
know. But when I arrived, and you hadn’t come, I suddenly
knew it was all true. I wanted to strangle poor old Regina
and her congratulations. That was almost an hour ago. I
was just thinking of going when you came.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She pressed his head against her slim bosom. “Poor darling,
it must have been awful. But you didn’t suppose I could
forget that I had invited you to supper to-night of all nights?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a fool, I realize it. But I’m so mad about you, I’m
really not sane,” he whispered, his lips against the satin of her
throat. “You’re an angel to put up with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed and put him aside. Springing to her feet she
gave the bell-rope a vigorous pull. “Nonsense! No angel
could possibly be as hungry as I am at present. Let us see
what Regina can do for us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the appetite was rather a pretense on both sides. They
were too excited to eat. With a discreet smile, Regina wheeled
in the supper on a tea wagon, and insisted upon leaving them
immediately, in spite of Alexis’ efforts to make up for his
former unamiability.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The <i>Signorino</i> must eat. Even music must die on the
empty stomach.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There were oysters on the half-shell, cold duck and a
varicolored salad that rivaled a Neapolitan sunset. Alexis opened
the champagne himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was awfully banal to have it,” laughed Anne. “But
we simply had to to-night, you know.” She raised her glass
and smiled at him, over its miniature golden cauldron. “To
Alexis Petrovskey and his triumph!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the power behind the throne,” he countered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The seething wine whipped their spirits. Between parted
lips, their teeth gleamed like crescent moons.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Alexis, you don’t know what to-night has meant to
me. Your success was as intoxicating as a personal triumph.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was one, wasn’t it? Since I owe every bit of it to you?”
His eyes were full of worship.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t say that. The power was within yourself. I
merely set it in motion again. I fully believe it would have
returned to you eventually.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not so sure of that. I was pretty nearly done for,
when you retrieved me. How can I ever thank you enough?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up from the table, and running around to her side,
threw his arms about her shoulders. She tossed back her head
and their lips met.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t think of that now,” she murmured, as he dropped
to his knees beside her. Conscious of the pathetic weariness
in her voice, an icy band tightened about his heart. He must
be more careful, or he would lose her entirely. Ah, how
clumsy he had been! What a fool to let her slip through his
fingers in that mad fashion. Like a woman who fears to lose
her lover, he must exert all his charm, every vestige of personality
he possessed in order to retain her. The band tightening
about his heart, he smiled up at her with pathetic
blandishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are so beautiful to-night in your gown of palest
green,” he whispered. “Like Venus rising from the waves.
I adore you more every minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed softly in her throat. “You are an incorrigible
baby, Alexis. Come, get up and eat a little more supper, or
Regina will be disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will, if I can put my chair next to yours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, foolish one!” She watched with a tender,
rather tired little smile, while he moved his chair from across
the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me, were you frightened to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed happily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not for a moment. It seemed as if I had the confidence
of a thousand devils!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is more than I can say for myself. I had an awful
attack of stage-fright. My knees rattled beneath me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do care, don’t you?” His voice was exultant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very much more than you will ever guess, Alexis!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Darling!” He squeezed her hand ecstatically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When you play at the Philharmonic on Friday I’ll not be
afraid at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her tenderly. “Why should you be if I’m not,
sweetheart? You mustn’t make yourself ill over me. You’ve
heard me play the Brahm’s Concerto many times, and you
know that it is mine, or rather that I am its!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They laughed at his comical way of putting it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I intend to play it in Boston next week, too,” he continued.
“How I loathe these trips that take me away from
you! When the ocean separates us I shall be wild. But you
will join me as soon as you can on the Continent? If you
don’t want me to come to Florence we can meet in Venice,
perhaps. I have set my heart on Venice. Think of us in a
palazzo over the pole-shadowed waters. We will wind in and
out of the tiny canals, in a gondola beneath a golden moon,
and I will play to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You would take all the trade from the Grand Canal, and
we should be solitary for about half a second!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, is it a bargain?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” she was a little breathless. “And in the
mornings we can bathe at the Lido.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The mornings! They can take care of themselves! It
is the nights, the glorious, moon-ridden nights that I am thinking
of. I will hold you in my arms on a dim, star-lit balcony,
while the gondolas swish by below and the water laps against
the base of our walls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And tourists rend the heavens with raucous laughter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He swept her into his arms impetuously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, let me stay to-night. Don’t send me back to
Gramercy Park alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His heart-beats against her cheek, she demurred faintly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Impossible, darling. You must go. Indeed, you ought to
be going now. The servants may return at any moment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what difference does that make? Pray, do they
invade your sitting room at this hour of the night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—but Regina——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can put you to bed, as usual. I shall have gone, you see.
But I can come back. There are such things as latch-keys,
aren’t there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you should be caught!” Her heart swooped in
delightful fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I shan’t,” he countered triumphantly. “In the morning
I shall creep out long before your lordly butler is awake.
Surely, you can’t refuse me anything to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her laugh was smothered against his breast. She could feel
his heart knocking against her lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Romeo and Juliet all over again, without even omitting
the nurse!” she murmured. “It is really awfully unoriginal
of us, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His lips within the brazen gold of her hair, he laughed
exultantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes later the street door closed with rather
unnecessary emphasis. Roused from her doze in Anne’s bedroom,
Regina started up thankfully. The <i>Signorino</i> was gone.
That was good. That was as it should be. Now her lady
could have a reposeful night. She had looked so weary this
evening!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />TRICKERY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The conventional living room was rendered gay by masses
of spring flowers. Padding from vase to vase, Mme.
Petrovskey inhaled their fragrance with triumphant nostrils.
A tribute to her motherhood from some of Alexis’ admirers,
she breathed them in luxuriantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now that Alexis had become a personage again, there was
no telling what the future might contain. Visions of reconciliation
loomed enticingly before her. If he came to-night,
and he would surely come (she had worded her letter with
guile) she had that to suggest which ought to render him
eternally grateful. The hated stumbling block, once removed
from his path, he would turn to her again and she would bask
not only in the vicarious sunshine of his fame, but in those
benign social rays shed by his pinnacle amongst the élite. And
it would be she, his mother, who had thrust him there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not that she really hated Claire. Poor, dear child, she had
been very useful up to the time of the marriage, and even
afterwards—for a while! But now she was no longer desirable.
The other woman could do so much more for Alexis.
Abetted by fortune and prestige, his genius would soar untrammeled.
Claire must be forced to see reason. Gently, of
course, if possible. But if she refused (Mme. Petrovskey
shrugged) drastic measures must be applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides, she was sick of the very sight of the girl. Heavy-bodied
and heavy-eyed, she crept about the rooms like a doomed
Madonna. Her idle days seemed to pass in a dread
anticipation, as if the horizon were stunted, the whole future cramped
into the next few weeks. That her thoughts did not progress
beyond the birth of the child, Mme. Petrovskey was almost
certain, although a deep-seated joy over Alexis’ success shone
from the somber eyes, when she read the criticisms in the
papers. After a concert, she would sometimes sit for hours,
the articles crumpled in ardent hands, only showing animation
when Dr. Elliott came around. Then she would dress with
unusual care, and covering her clumsy little figure with a
heavy coat, sally forth to dinner or the theater with a grateful
air, very irritating to a bored mother-in-law. At such times,
Mme. Petrovskey suspected Claire of using rouge. For the
small face bloomed into unexpected beauty.</p>

<p class='c008'>That Dr. Elliott found it so, was amusingly apparent to
the watchful older woman, whose eyes, more subtle than those
of Claire, pierced his armor to the palpitating, defenseless
flesh. Decidedly, the man was in love with Claire. Whether
this love had been declared was problematical and immaterial.
It suited Mme. Petrovskey’s purpose, and provided her with
a weapon almost invincible. That the weapon was poisoned,
contrary to the laws of honorable warfare, troubled her not
one whit.</p>

<p class='c008'>And to-night the stage was set, the scene garnished for the
blow. The time itself nicely calculated. To insure her <i>tête-à-tête</i>,
Mme. Petrovskey had chosen an evening when she
knew that Claire expected to go to the movies with the doctor.
She had even taken the precaution to send Ito out. His stolid
devotion to the girl might prove a nuisance. And she did not
intend to risk any eavesdropping from behind pantry doors.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the time approached for Alexis to come, her calm,
superficially stolid, was agitated to the depths. Beyond a
few words, after his recital, this was the first opportunity
she had had for an interview, and the very utmost must be
gleaned from it. There was no telling when another would
be forthcoming; so unfilial had Alexis become. Perhaps
when the fear of encountering Claire had been removed,
his visits might become more frequent. Of the absurdity
of hoping that he ever would live with her again, she was
not guilty. When the bird has once flown, the nest soon
becomes outgrown. It would not even be desirable. In the
dazzling future, Alexis would necessarily reside (her own
pompous word) elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>The weaving of these half-poetic, entirely vulgar dreams
filled the woman with anticipatory satisfaction. When the
door-bell shrilled, it surprised her. She responded in dignified
leisure that belied the turmoil within.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Ito’s evening out,” she explained rather effusively.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stiff, very correct, Alexis answered her smile with constraint.
As he hung his hat and coat upon the rack, a wave of
nausea sickened him; an influx of memories not to be borne.
Not for anything in the world, except the veiled promise contained
in his mother’s letter, would he have entered here again.
He followed her into the living room, glancing about him
apprehensively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You said Claire would not be at home,” he articulated
thickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so she isn’t!” Mme. Petrovskey plumped herself
into a large tapestry chair and motioned him to do likewise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She and Dr. Elliott have gone out on one of their little
sprees.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her sprightly manner irritated Alexis unbearably, and he
was silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought it would be nice for us to be alone. Don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have no desire to see Claire, as you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I imagine, dear boy. But don’t let us speak of that
now. First I want to congratulate you upon your success. It
simply delights me. You’re twice as good as ever. More
assured, more mature. Your rendering of the Brahm’s Concerto
was perfection. Lauer was transported by it. He said
you were the best pupil he had ever had.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis’s eyes lighted momentarily at the mention of his old
master.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He came around to see me afterwards and was—very
kind,” he said almost eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He ought to be pleased! Even Sascha doesn’t do him more
credit!” she exclaimed with complacence.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the glow had departed from Alexis’ face. He had not
come to discuss music, and he wished she would get to the
point.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although she could not always comprehend his moods, his
impatience did not escape her now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you are wondering why I wrote you to come
to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Frankly, yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I speak plainly?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It has not taken much intuition on my part to know that
you would like to divorce Claire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He avoided the over-eager gaze. His mother’s attitude
towards Claire had always filled him with distaste. “I think
a divorce would be better for us both.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His obvious reluctance made her impatient.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What have you done about it?” she asked with a return of
the imperious manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised offended brows, but replied quietly enough. “I
have applied to Rome for an annulment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed curtly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think there is a chance of its being granted?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps not. But I have stated the facts and hope to get
justice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her lips curled disdainfully. “There isn’t the slightest
chance for you, Alexis. Claire is a devoted daughter of the
Church, and they won’t risk losing her for an agnostic like
yourself. If I were you, I shouldn’t lay any hopes upon it,
but put all my energy into procuring a divorce.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Claire refuses to divorce me. It would be easy enough
for her, God knows, if she wanted to!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On the charge of desertion, I suppose!” A smile played
about the tiny mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>His anger disdained subterfuge. “On the charge of
infidelity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head, mandarin-wise. “But that would ruin
your career.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should it? People don’t go to hear an artist because
he’s a woolly lamb. Music isn’t dependent upon the blue laws.
If Puritans were able to interpret it, I know many a Symphony
that would have to be discarded.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her laugh was full of <i>camaraderie</i>. “You are right. But
suppose you should want to marry again? The scandal might
prove a detriment to the lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked disconcerted. It had never occurred to him that
Anne’s reputation might suffer if his freedom came as the
result of scandal. It had been abominably careless of him.
But why worry since Claire refused to divorce him?</p>

<p class='c008'>His mother noted his discomfiture with amusement. When
she considered that he had sufficiently digested it, she tackled
him once again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is you who must do the divorcing,” she announced
judicially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I?” He stared at her in bewilderment. “But that would
be impossible. In the first place it would be dastardly. In
the second, there are no grounds, as you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are there not?” Her smile angered him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure I don’t know what we are talking about. We
are getting nowhere. If you have any communication to
make, please do so at once, as I have an engagement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The baby-blue stare narrowed into a slit. “Wasn’t it natural
that I should desire to see my own son again?” she
asked sweetly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked sulky. “If you are anxious about money,
arrangements are being made for both you and Claire, which
ought to secure you an ample income. That is, if my strong
right arm continues to wield the bow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is generous of you, my son.” She waved a gracious
hand. A dissatisfied look crept into her eyes. “But since you
insist upon being so frank, I may as well tell you that money
has nothing to do with my invitation. I asked you to come
because I can help you, if not in your career, at least in your
happiness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My happiness? I don’t understand you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She continued to smile blandly. “I think I can show you a
way out of your marriage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How?” His scornful eyes were incredulous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey smoothed her silken lap, as a cat smoothes
its fur. “There is a man in Claire’s life, Alexis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded ponderously. “She is out with him now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you mean the doctor?” There was comical relief in
his voice. “What harm is there in that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Much harm could be construed from it. Besides, the man
is in love with her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis stared. The idea of any one being in love with
Claire seemed both preposterous and impertinent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is here almost every day. They go out together at
least one night a week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is probably sorry for her, or lonesome, or both! You’re
not trying to insinuate there is anything wrong!” The male’s
hatred of being betrayed, even when it affords him a loophole
for escape rang in his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One must avoid the appearance of evil,” she said sanctimoniously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense. What are you driving at? If you don’t approve
of what they are doing, why do you permit it, as Claire
is presumably under your protection?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sometimes it is better to let matters run their course.”
She fixed her eyes upon him cunningly. A flicker of comprehension
twisted his features.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you were willing to abet them?” he retorted with contempt.
“‘Adultery made easy for beginners,’ or ‘Homely
Hints from a Fond Mother-in-law!’ Oh, this is detestable!
I am going!” He flung his hair out of his eyes and started
towards the hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I merely tried to help you,” she followed him with ponderous
lightness. “You may be sorry that you didn’t take
advantage of my advice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He started to put on his coat. “But I don’t believe any of
this, mother. It is all such utter rot. Claire is incapable of
such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps she is, and perhaps she isn’t! At any rate, how
could she prove her innocence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laid a heavy hand upon Alexis’s arm. He shrank away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you imagine I would ruin an innocent woman? What
kind of a man do you think I am?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shrugged fat shoulders. “Not if it were avoidable, of
course. But how do you know she is innocent? She has had
every opportunity to deceive you. A lonely woman will do
desperate things, Alexis. Love is a great temptation to a girl
like Claire, and half a loaf is better than none!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Claire! I can’t imagine Claire being unfaithful.
She is the most loyal creature alive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She may be loyal, but she is also passionate. You at least
should retain some memory of that.” The innocent eyes
concealed amusement.</p>

<p class='c008'>He flushed. The memory of Claire’s surrenders was like
a vague but abject nightmare. Yes, the girl possessed a lurid
kind of passivity, a submission as unlike Anne’s goddess-like
generosity as night from day. Mme. Petrovskey pursued her
advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It remains to be seen which of the two traits is the
stronger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I know. It would take Claire’s own words to
convince me to the contrary.” But his manner was less
ironical, almost receptive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey took up her theme complacently. “Think
it over, Alexis. Don’t permit an obstinate girl to ruin your
life. You love another woman——”</p>

<p class='c008'>A dangerous gleam in his eye, he checked her quickly.
“We will not speak of that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well. Only, as I was going to say before, it is not
as if you loved Claire and she could keep you. By clinging
stubbornly to you, she is merely ruining her own life as well.
I believe Dr. Elliott would marry her if she were free.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A new eagerness flitted over Alexis’ face. “If I thought
there was a chance of that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She would have to be forced into it, of course. She is
as obstinate about her religion as she is weak about you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t intend to force her! I’m sorry I came. When I
received your letter I thought you would have something
tangible to suggest. Something beside these brutalities.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I offer you freedom and you call me names!” The tiny
mouth pursed with rage. “But wait a moment, I’m afraid you
can’t go now. They’re back from the movies. Isn’t that the
elevator?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The blood receded from Alexis’s face. Yes, surely that
was Claire’s voice approaching the door. Would to God he
had never come!</p>

<p class='c008'>A key clicked in the lock and Claire stood upon the
threshold. Behind her Dr. Elliott turned white as he saw
Alexis. Placing a mechanical arm about Claire, he piloted
her in. She fell into a chair beside the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis!” Tears streamed from her eyes. Her voice was
feeble.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sprang forward with a cry of pity and bent over her.
“I’m sorry I frightened you, Claire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so silly,” she murmured. “Only last night I dreamed
that you had returned again!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor child!” His face contracted in a spasm of pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I want to tell you how happy I am over your success!
I heard you at the Philharmonic yesterday and—and it was
glorious!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are always so generous,” he felt broken with shame.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Generous! You call it that?” she retorted scornfully.
Drawing her cape about her carefully, she preceded them into
the living room. “Come in, Robert, I want you to meet my—my
husband,” she added, with a pathetic assumption of ease.</p>

<p class='c008'>A grim expression on his face, the young doctor broke his
silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can only stay a few minutes. I ought to go back to
the hospital,” he said gruffly. But if Claire needed him, he
would not fail her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey smiled, as she caught his belligerent eye.
“Do stay, we will have a nice little chat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hear you have been to the movies,” said Alexis, after
they had settled themselves more or less stiffly about the
room. Why in hell didn’t the man get out?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Elliott is very good to me,” broke in Claire naïvely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis cursed inwardly. Did she expect him to thank the
man for taking her off his hands?</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is Mrs. Petrovskey who has been good,” retorted Elliott
more gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shouldn’t place the guilt entirely upon her shoulders!”
laughed Mme. Petrovskey with a kittenish air. “I have often
feared that Dr. Elliott in his kindness of heart, must be
neglecting his work. I assure you he and Claire have been
inseparable all winter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Elliott glared. “I’m afraid you are exaggerating. But
Mrs. Petrovskey’s occasional company has proved a great boon
to a lonely chap like myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Occasional!” exclaimed Mme. Petrovskey. “I should
hardly call it that, dear Dr. Elliott!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It has seemed so to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, the young are so impetuous!” She raised innocent
eyes to the ceiling. “They are never contented with less
than all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You choose to be playful,” said the doctor, with a guarded
little smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis admired the man’s restraint. He, himself, fidgeted
uneasily. Did his mother have no decency at all?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t we getting rather serious?” he demanded. What
a ghastly scene! Why couldn’t the fellow go home? Perhaps
he was in love with Claire, after all?</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a serious subject.” Mme. Petrovskey was still
sprightly. “Repressed desires are almost as serious as unrepressed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor laughed. “Ah, now you are getting on familiar
ground. When it comes to Freud, or his fellow Paul Prys,”
his eye gleamed dangerously, “I can argue with the best of
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey nodded gayly. “Do you follow the new
method of free expression?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe that one’s desires, if decent, should be gratified.”
He fixed his eyes upon Claire’s face with an expression at
once baffling and affectionate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey bridled. “There are so many standards
of decency, aren’t there? And that of a young doctor might
be considered lax by an old fogy like myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis shot her a tortured glance. “Since when have you
become so interested in Psycho-Analysis? This is getting too
high-brow for Claire and me, isn’t it, Claire?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She met his harried gaze with an apologetic smile at once
pleading and listless. “I’m afraid I wasn’t paying much
attention.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey turned towards her punctiliously. Her
eyes beneath the smile seemed to strip the girl to the bone,
and Claire cowered away as from a limelight. “You had
better listen, dear child. For the matter concerns you
profoundly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Concerns me?” she muttered inexplicably uneasy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, indeed,” playfully. “We’re talking about the doctor’s
repressed and unrepressed desires.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What have I to do with them?” Her voice was cold with
dawning fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are trying to discover in which of the two pigeon-holes
you belong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” Claire’s pale lips parted on a cry. She half rose
from her chair. Alexis sprang across the room to her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is too much!” he exclaimed. “Why do you torture
the child?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because Mme. Petrovskey wants me to confess that I
love Claire!” Dr. Elliott’s tones rang clear.</p>

<p class='c008'>They all looked at him in amazement. A calm exultation
in his eyes, he faced them squarely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you deny it?” A smile of triumph played about the
older woman’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can. But I will not!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire hid her face in shaking hands. “Oh, Robert,” she
sobbed, “please don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He approached and stood over her with quiet strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should I deny the most beautiful thing in my life?
That would be to lower it to the level of Mme. Petrovskey’s
insinuations.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The latter started up from her chair with a cry of suppressed
fury. The baby-blue orbs flashed hell-fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You—you——!” she commenced. Then turned to
Alexis with a resumption of her habitual sweetness. “What
did I tell you? Was I not right?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep quiet,” he commanded. “You have made trouble
enough for one evening!” He turned to Dr. Elliott. “So
you are in love with my wife?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other man looked down upon him from his greater
height. “I have done you no wrong, Petrovskey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire raised a white and streaming face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh Alexis, you do believe him, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He patted her trembling hand, with absent-minded kindliness.
“Don’t worry, child. Of course I believe him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Robert Elliott grasped him by the shoulder. “You are a
real man, Petrovskey. I didn’t know you had it in you!” he
exclaimed naïvely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis’ smile was a trifle awry. “You are wrong, Elliott.
If I were a real man, all this would never have occurred.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His mother interposed herself between them almost savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All this magnanimity looks very pretty. But what proof
have you that they are not lying? I, for one, don’t believe
in this blessed innocence. Many a divorce has been granted
on less substantial grounds than these!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire stumbled to her feet, and stood swaying against
the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are a wicked woman! How dare you lie about me
and Dr. Elliott? I shall not stay under the same roof with
you for another night!” She moved blindly forward towards
the corridor. Alexis pursued her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you going? What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned upon him like a hounded creature. “Let me
alone, I am going to pack,” she cried at bay. “I am going
to pack,” she repeated wildly. She stumbled down the
corridor towards her room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey reseated herself. “Running away is
hardly the action of an innocent woman!” she remarked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be silent!” exclaimed Elliott sternly. But he was too
late for Claire had heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” With a gasping cry she faced them. Then crashed
forward like a felled tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have killed her!” Alexis ran down the corridor,
and knelt beside the small, prostrate figure. He was about
to lift it in his arms when the doctor interfered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put her down on her back. Here, let me do it.” He
shifted Claire expertly. “Don’t you know that a fainting
patient must never be lifted? It sometimes kills them,
especially in her condition.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In her condition?” Alexis looked up from rubbing
Claire’s hands. “What do you mean? Is her heart affected?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Squatting upon his haunches the doctor uncorked his brandy
flask. As he leaned over to pour the liquid between Claire’s
teeth, he looked Alexis squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your wife is pregnant,” he said shortly. “It is time you
knew it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An ashy pallor overspread Alexis’ face. His heart leaped
sickeningly. Then tolled against his ribs like a knell. It
tolled so raspingly—it tolled so loudly that all the world—that
Anne herself must hear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t you let me know?” he demanded softly.
Was he never to cease paying for the feeble nightmare which
had made Claire his? “Why was I not told?” he repeated
with the same irate quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Robert Elliott looked at him with grudging compassion.
So the fellow could feel after all? Well, it was time he
did! A throb of hatred seared him. “She did not wish to
have you know. It was a matter of pride. She had no use
for your pity, she only wanted you——” he hesitated over the
word, “your love.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before the suffering in the man’s eyes, Alexis lowered his
own. They fell upon the pinched features of the swooning
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is coming to,” he whispered, between dry lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like folded pansies, the dark eyes slowly unfurled. Into
their shadowed depths Alexis plunged his agony and his shame.
“Claire, what have I done to you?” he groaned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pansies opened wide. Terror crept into their wounded
depths. The pale lips twisted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have told him?” She looked up at Robert Elliott
reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded. “Yes.” His voice died into a hoarse murmur.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How dared you when I’d forbidden it?” she cried weakly.
Great tears slid down the hollow cheeks. She suddenly burst
into uncontrollable, frenzied sobs that shook the feeble body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fear gripped Alexis as he watched her writhe in a vain
effort to control herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t, dear Claire,” he cried, touching with clumsy fingers
a lock of hair which clung against the drenched cheek.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wanted to spare you this,” she gasped, raising drowned
eyes to his.</p>

<p class='c008'>A flood of shame swept over Alexis, together with an
unbearable, wrenching pity. Pity for the suffering he had
inflicted. Shame for the unheeded seed sowed so wantonly
and without love. Despair that his heart should be empty
of all save compassion. Futile, shameful anger against Claire
that it was she, the unloved, and not Anne, who was to mother
his first-born. Face drawn and gray, he bent over Claire
in an agony of contrition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t, Claire, don’t. You will hurt yourself!” He
looked up at the doctor, who had risen and was trying to
appear unconscious of a scene which was literally tearing at
his very marrow. “Hadn’t we better carry her into her
room and put her to bed, Elliott?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The power of speech had deserted Elliott. He nodded.
They were about to gather her up in their arms, but Claire
pushed them away, almost with violence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I will not stop here another night, with Aunt. I
couldn’t bear it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis shot a desperate look at the other man, who shook
his head gravely. “She had better be humored,” he said
decisively.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claire’s sobs grew fainter. She looked up at Dr. Elliott
gratefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis forced himself to a bitter decision. “How would
you like to go to my apartment in Gramercy Park?” he asked
with dreadful reluctance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Surprise choked back Claire’s sobs. “Do you mean it?
Wouldn’t I be awfully in your way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not. There is a day-bed in the studio where
I can sleep. I have often used it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was true enough. A burning mist clouded his eyes.
He turned away to conceal it. With what memories of Anne
was the alcove not hallowed?</p>

<p class='c008'>Eyes upon his averted face, Claire’s lips quivered. “Have
you given up your house in Long Island?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He avoided her glance with a sense of pity. “I still have
it until the first of April. However, I always sleep in town
on concert days, and very often at other times. But you
needn’t worry about being a nuisance, for I am leaving on
tour the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, yes, I had forgotten.” Claire’s voice sounded dreary.
“There was something in the paper about it. If you will
help me up, I think I’ll go and dress.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Their arms beneath hers, she struggled to her feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you feel able to dress?” asked Elliott as she swayed
a little. “Why do you hurry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, oh yes,” she pushed the hair back from her damp
brow. “I must go at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked slowly towards her bedroom. The clumsy
gait, the fragile, swollen body struck Alexis for the first time.
Filled with compassion and a sick sort of repulsion of which
he was fiercely ashamed, he turned to Dr. Elliott.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you please see that Claire has a nurse? A nice,
cheerful one. I don’t want her to be lonely. There is a
cleaning woman who comes in by the day who will cook
for them until we can procure some one better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll telephone for one.” Elliott shot a glance charged
with meaning after the tragic figure retreating up the hall.
“For God’s sake be kind to her, Petrovskey!” He whispered
huskily, as Claire’s door closed behind her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis passed a hand over his trembling mouth. “I’ll try
to, God knows! But you ought to have married her, Elliott.
You could have made her happy!” he replied with aching
humility.</p>

<p class='c008'>They walked slowly back to the living room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elliott slipped into the ante-room to telephone. As he
waited for his number there was a stoic, Indian savagery
about his face. Wild, unbidden thoughts rose like green
scum to the clear surface of his mind. If Claire’s child
should die, all might yet be well. The last link between her
and Alexis sundered, she might possibly be induced to give
him up forever. But if—it lived——! With a knowing
leer, temptation nudged his elbow, puffing its vile breath into
his clean nostrils. He shook the beast off angrily and
responded to the operator’s voice when it came with detached
calm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, Alexis had flung himself into a chair beside
the living-room table, burying his face upon its surface. For
him the radiant dream was over. He had awakened to the
same grim and joyless world which had once before tried to
slay him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mme. Petrovskey had come out from her room at the sound
of their return. She approached Alexis stealthily. Her bulk
cast a bloated shadow on the wall. It crouched over him
like a beast of prey. “So you have let yourself be conquered
by a nobody, an unloved waif? Fie, you are weak! You
are allowing yourself to be dragged into a mediocrity more
loathsome than death. That is not for you. You are a
genius. Spread your wings, fly away before you lose all
capacity to soar. Fly away! Your bird of paradise awaits
you. Do such as you mate with the sparrows?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His mother’s words, or his own subconscious mind? What
matter? It voiced his weeping soul.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />SACRIFICIAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The city was muffled in fog. It brooded over Fifth
Avenue, oozing rain like an enormous sponge. Beneath
its clammy drip, dirty snow melted into unwholesome puddles,
street lamps haloed goldenly. It was after midnight and the
broad, deserted pavement glistened like some dark river upon
which a few rare craft slid by in ghostly procession. Occasional
passers-by, beneath outspreading umbrellas, looked
strangely fungoid. Their breath issuing in small clouds,
seemed to congeal and solidify upon reaching the air as if
the fog itself were composed of the warm emanations of
mankind. Alexis hurried drearily up the avenue. With
Claire safely installed in the apartment and companioned
by a nurse, there was nothing further for him to do. He
was free momentarily. Free to savor to the full the bitterness
of the cup he had set to his lips. But the evening had
left him numb as well as distraught. He was conscious only
of an overmastering impulse to rush out into the streets,
to drown identity in fog, lose self in some demoniac outburst.</p>

<p class='c008'>Huge gulps of the chill air in his lungs, he staggered forward
as if propelled by a monster wind, eyes fixed in front of
him, burning a path through the drizzling mist. An empty
taxi glided close to the curb. He hailed it mechanically and
gave the man Anne’s address. A moment later they had
joined the current on the black and glistening river.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, he would not disturb Anne. That would be
sheer cruelty. But he must be near to her somehow. That
was an exquisite torture which he was too weak to forego.
Once there, he would dismiss his taxi and hug close to the
wall which sheltered her. After that he had no plans. The
future was not more dark nor indefinite than the immediate
night before him. There was only one thing certain in his
mind. He could not return to Gramercy Park. That was
a grinning horror which his embryonic Quixotry was too
feeble to face.</p>

<p class='c008'>A rapid transit up the avenue brought them to the shrouded
park. They skirted its graveyard shore to the Seventies, and
then swerved into Anne’s street. As they neared the house
Alexis smothered a cry of irritation. The façade was brilliant
with lights. It shone luminous through the fog like the
golden exit from a tunnel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, how foolish to have forgotten! This was
Anne’s night at the opera, and she was having some people
in afterwards. He had been invited to join them but had
refused as usual. The hilarious horde was his particular
abomination, and it was seldom that Anne could persuade
him into one of these parties. She did not try very hard,
for as the season progressed she herself had become utterly
wearied with it all. It was only fear of appearing both
snobbish and unkind which prevented her from breaking away
altogether. And Alexis knew his presence made it more
difficult. The malice of Ellen, who could not forgive Anne
for not confiding in her, the jealousy of Gerald, created a
tension. So, although always invited, Alexis’ absence had
evolved into a kind of unwritten law.</p>

<p class='c008'>But to-night was different. A desperate night, created for
the breaking of all rules. A frantic, lawless night, lying between
the boundaries of time like a savage bandit-ridden tract,
dividing two civilized states. To-night all forms of excitement
were unabhorrent, even the ribald efforts of the horde.
At any rate, their presence would afford an opportunity to
see Anne, to be near her, to breathe in the beloved atmosphere
while she still remained unconscious of the barrier which
had fallen between them forever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fever surging in his veins, Alexis dismissed his taxi.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inside the house, there was the usual uproar of music and
dancing. Unperceived for the moment, Alexis stood upon
the threshold of the huge living room. His eyes flashed
through the swirling couples, searching for Anne. But she
was not upon the floor. Seated at the Steinway, Gerald was
playing with delicate ferocity. His young, almost beautiful
face, glowered cynically as he glanced at the dancers.
Grotesque syncopations dripped from his swooping fingertips.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis started to wedge his way to the other end of the
room. The eyes of the two men met with a shock. A
smile distorted Gerald’s lips. The music ceased almost
discordantly. Everybody stopped dancing. For a moment
the world stood still.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look who’s here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>In a flame-colored chiffon frock, Olive Fay darted up to
Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please dance with me, Mr. Petrovskey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, that’s what I came for!” His hard gaze
hovered over her naked young shoulders. “But first, where
is my hostess?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She pouted. “How old-fashioned of you to remember your
hostess! But come along, Old Ironsides, if you must.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The dancing had recommenced. They dashed through
revolving couples to the sofa in front of the fire, where Anne
was sitting with a large, dark man, whom Alexis recognized
as Del Re, the South American opera singer. In a dream-like
dance dress of sapphire tulle over pale-green chiffon, the
emerald pendant upon her breast, Anne watched their approach
with concealed astonishment. So Alexis had come
after all! Why? The brilliant eyes, the twisted smile puzzled
her. Had he been listening to some rumor about Del
Re? Was the old serpent of jealousy once more coiling to
strike her long-suffering head?</p>

<p class='c008'>“How nice of you to change your mind!” she murmured,
a question beneath her composure, “Have you met Señor Del
Re? Mr. Petrovskey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The familiar pang gnawing at his vitals, Alexis suppressed
it savagely. “Who does not know the celebrated Mephisto?
You have given me many a thrill, Señor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there a thrill left in New York?” Del Re’s crooked
eyebrow curved whimsically. “I thought they were all in
your violin, Petrovskey! Thrills? You are the master
there!” There was genuine admiration in the cello-like tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, isn’t he wonderful?” shrilled Olive. “I am going to
dance with him this very minute. I’ve simply got to be seen
in his company, that’s all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very flattering, isn’t she!” Flashing a blazing glance
into Anne’s face, Alexis laughed loudly, then turned to
Olive. “Did you bring your press-agent along?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mean thing!” She dragged him on to the floor with
another shrill squeal. They danced away. Her mocking
eyes on his face, she cackled gayly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No use in looking at Anne like that, Mr. Petrovskey.
Might as well make up your mind to lose her. He can get
’em whenever he wants to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dragging his eyes from Anne’s face, Alexis hid his crimson
anger like a wound. “He has a record, has he?” He crushed
Olive to him savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh yes,” she gasped, mistaking his clasp for ardor. “And
what he hasn’t been through! Thrust in the stomach with
bayonets. Scarred with shrapnel. Face lifted at least twice.
You know they say he is almost seventy. But what with
Steinach and surgery, you’d never dream it, would you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never!” They circled the room in abandoned unison.
As they reached the sofa again, Alexis rudely relaxed his hold
and sank into the couch upon the other side of Anne. With
a chagrined laugh, Olive fell into a chair next to Del Re.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He doesn’t seem to appreciate me, does he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you dance with me?” Alexis whispered into Anne’s
ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course!” She did not know Alexis in this reckless,
Byronical mood. Could he have had a little too much to
drink? She watched him down the whisky and soda just
passed by the footman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis caught her troubled glance. He nodded gayly. “It’s
all right. Don’t be frightened. I’m not drunk with anything
except you. You are <i>crème de Menthe</i> in a dark-blue
glass, and very intoxicating.” He pointed to the green lining
of the sapphire gown.</p>

<p class='c008'>Laughingly, they started to dance. Almost of equal height,
faces on a level, their breath mingled in a single stream.
Their bodies swayed to the rhythmic breeze of a waltz. Radio
music this time. Dance orchestra from the Drake Hotel,
Chicago. And although unromantically canned, most peppy
and enticing; vitamins intact. As she and Alexis swung
by Ellen, Anne caught her amused smile. Sitting between
Gerald, who was smoking furiously, and Caldenas, doing
nothing at all in his usual cherubic fashion, she appeared
serenely malicious, like some complaisant goddess of the
senses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne shivered and drew closer to Alexis. His clasp
tightened tempestuously about the slim, ungirdled body. He
danced her out into the hall. Swooping into a remote corner,
he stopped abruptly, and pressed his lips upon hers. The
Sparkling eyes were so close that she felt as if she were being
sucked into the expanded pupils, as into a bottomless whirlpool.
She went pale and a little giddy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter with you to-night, Alexis?” she
whispered as they started to dance again.</p>

<p class='c008'>His lashes swept her forehead like a caress. He did not
reply but continued to look into her eyes with the same disturbing
gaze. Holding her as in a vise, their limbs interlocked,
merged, in rapturous fusion. Stabbing weakness pierced Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t,” she supplicated faintly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Muffled against her hair, his laugh rumbled dizzily through
her head. His lips brushed her cheek, mumbling softly at
the pink lobe of her ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I like you to-night!” Her whisper was
breathless.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sardonic laughter was repeated. The eyes fixed upon
hers flared hotly. Anne was afraid. As they whirled giddily
back into the noisy room, she welcomed with relief the
announcement of supper.</p>

<p class='c008'>They all trooped into the dining room and seated themselves
as they pleased at small tables, which lent the vast
room the festive air of a récherché little restaurant. Varicolored
bowls of copper-hued tulips with glass candlesticks to
match adorned each table, sounding a rich note against the
gray tempera walls. Adroitly shed by Anne, Alexis discovered
himself between a young Roumanian noblewoman, almost as
beautiful as Queen Marie in her prime, and a well-known
authoress, whose Savonarola profile stared austerely beneath
close-cropped hair. Opposite sat a young nondescript, one of
those indispensable stop-gaps whose white shirt-fronts fill
the social vacuum so perfectly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young countess was, according to the society column,
decidedly vivacious. This was her first visit to the United
States, and she was collecting scalps as well as impressions.
Alexis’ golden mane was not to be disdained. She courted
him assiduously all through supper and he made contemptuously
free response. The honey-colored hair, the
sweet-scented body intrigued him very little. He knew that he
could have her with a single gesture from his famous fingers.
He had met her kind before, a little less beautiful perhaps,
certainly more blatant, but equally voracious of sensation. A
liaison with Alexis Petrovskey or any other famous artist
would furnish welcome tidbit for dainty jaws.</p>

<p class='c008'>A hectic spot upon each cheek, he ate his supper in a sort
of petrified excitement, scarcely aware of the audacious words
his lips were uttering; absolutely ignorant of the food he put
between them. He drank the sparkling wine feverishly. It
spread through his body and was absorbed like spilled ink
upon a blotter. Beyond the saturnine profile of the authoress,
he occasionally caught Anne’s eyes fixed upon him from a
neighboring table. Beneath their serene surface he glimpsed
a troubled question. Was she, too, suffering? Did she sense
his pain? His unutterable, stupefying torture? Or did she
merely find him volatile and unstable? Well, she would
understand it all soon enough, God knows!</p>

<p class='c008'>What a nightmare!</p>

<p class='c008'>Supper over, the crowd overflowed into the living room.
Seated at the piano, Del Re was preparing to sing. Her hand
upon his arm, his beautiful neighbor lured Alexis into a
remote window-seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, we can listen in comfort,” she murmured, approaching
felinely. Her bare flesh grazed his shoulder. He
lighted his cigarette from hers, leaning unnecessarily close.
It amused him to whet her genteel nymphomania.</p>

<p class='c008'>Del Re sang an aria from Mephisto with diabolic grandeur.
Then broke into a series of Spanish folk songs. The vibrating,
cello-like tones, the lilting accompaniment, were replete
with magnetism and created a furore. Close upon his
triumphant heels, followed Olive Fay, who executed a kicking
dance to Gerald’s devilishly clever improvisation. Rosy,
rouged knees emerging impudently from slit draperies, she
was the incarnation of Gerald’s heady and insinuating jazz.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was an unsteady silence, a self-conscious, tightened
silence. Lips parted feverishly, the wine-warmed crowd was
momentarily uneasy. Then it relaxed into uproarious applause.
Olive was lost amongst a bevy of shirt-fronts as
indispensable to her being as lipstick or rouge, and about as
impersonal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, they called upon Alexis. He came out from his
corner smiling and unexpectedly amiable. To Anne’s surprise,
he consented to contribute to the entertainment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you haven’t your violin!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t need it,” he replied, laughing lightly. “I intend
to be low-brow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Running his fingers over the piano keys, he clashed into
a disturbing medley, Chopin, Stravinsky, Mendelssohn and
Sowerby, Ornstein and Tchaikowsky, with a dash of MacDowell
as leaven. The audience howled approbation. “What
do you call it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked up demurely from the keys. “The Petrovskey
Blues!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He broke into a revised version of the popular negro melody,
transforming its plaintive simplicity into symphonic proportions.
Then with a swift transition, he began to ragtime an
old Italian opera. With a broad smile, Del Re strode to the
piano and sang an accompaniment, in the nasal drone of the
cabaret favorite. Negroid and scintillating, the parody ceased
upon a plaintive chord, reminiscent of some southern spiritual.</p>

<p class='c008'>Listeners crowded about the piano, jaded senses stirred to
the shallow depths. From the background, Anne watched
in fascinated silence. She did not dream Alexis had it in
him, and as she looked at the flushed face an undercurrent
of apprehension flowed like an icy stream below the surface of
her pleasure. What could have excited him so to-night
that he had ventured forth from his shell with such uncharacteristic
fireworks? At Anne’s elbow, Caldenas grunted
appreciatively. He was putting the last touches to a caricature
of the two celebrities at the piano, which, as he quaintly
put it, would immortalize their genius as well as his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little Roumanian leaned over Alexis. Her perfume
weighed on his irritated nerves, nauseatingly heavy. “When
are you coming to see me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed loudly. His eyes stripped her. “Never!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She flushed and bit her naturally red lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are detestable. I am mad about you,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are maddeningly pretty, but I am immune,” he
retorted, smiling up into the flower-like face with curved,
saturnine lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>She rested her hand upon the keyboard next to his.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your music makes me feel positively wanton!” The blue
eyes swam amorously.</p>

<p class='c008'>He flung her hand away, with casual fingers. His glance
rent her unmercifully. “You are wasting your time!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She crumbled as if struck by lightning. Tears of mortification
rose to the lovely eyes. She stammered in utter rout,
“You are a fiend!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rose from the piano and looked about him smilingly.
“The end of a perfect day,” he remarked in a loud voice.
He shook hands with Del Re and retreated towards Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>With meaning looks the group began to break up. Their
guard of honor ranged about them, Ellen and Olive flitted
away to the accompaniment of knowing smiles. An obscure
and taciturn husband was claimed by the authoress and led
triumphantly home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The countess, a little pale, accepted the escort of Gerald
and Caldenas.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis waited flagrantly, while Del Re completed ceremonious
adieus.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the door closed upon them all, Anne turned towards
Alexis with an inquiring, slightly apprehensive air. “Are you
going to stay, Alexis? It is very late.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For response he drew her to him in an abrupt convulsive
gesture. Leading her to the sofa, he knelt and buried his
head on her lap. She brushed the hair back from his forehead
nervously. It was indiscreet of him to have remained
after the others had gone. She had caught interchanged
glances and knew that the worst interpretation would be made
of the situation. As he remained motionless, she spoke a
little wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter, dear? Why are you so excited
to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised a bloodless face, and she saw that his eyes were
swimming in tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh Anne, it is all over. This is the end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a smothered sob, he dropped his head back upon her
knees.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” Her voice was shocked. A
premonitory thrill sent a shiver over her body.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have taken Claire back again,” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>She uttered a cry and recoiled instinctively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand and—and I suppose I am glad,” she faltered,
with quick pride. She tried to remove his hold but his arms
tightened about her convulsively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no, you don’t understand at all. I don’t love her.
It isn’t that. It’s——” his eyes widened with horror, “Claire
is going to have a child,” he finished brokenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” Anne’s face became suddenly ashen. “I suppose
I should have foreseen this,” she murmured, pushing him
away from her almost roughly. “Oh, poor Claire, how
she must have suffered! How can I ever forgive myself?”
She wrung her hands in an unfamiliar gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stumbled to his feet and stood over her. “I didn’t know
it, Anne. I never dreamed of such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I suppose not, but that doesn’t make it any easier
for Claire, does it?” Her voice was dry and expressionless.
“When—when is it to be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shot her a tortured glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very soon, I am afraid.” He averted his working face.
“Oh Anne, don’t despise me. I was mad, beside myself
when it all happened. It is blurred, fantastic, like the
memory of some confused dream.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His miserable voice pierced Anne’s pride. She put her
arms about him and drew him down on to the couch beside
her. “Poor Alexis, my poor, poor boy,” she crooned
sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hid his face against the back of the sofa. “I am cursed,
I seem to blast all those who love me,” he choked. “Oh,
Anne, if you had seen her pitiful little face! I am not fit
to live!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, it is terrible for her, of course. But it was not
your fault. You were horribly unfortunate, that is all.”
She stroked his shoulder, all the aching tenderness of her
heart in her finger-tips. “And now you are going to make
it all up to her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He returned her look with dumb, suffering eyes. “How the
gods must hate me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A little shudder ran through her. What was the adage?
“Whom the gods destroy, they first make mad”? She placed
her hand upon his lips. “Don’t say that. I can’t bear to
hear you. Nobody hates you, least of all the gods. It is
only that you are not as other men. Suffering seems to be
the price exacted of genius.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I were a clerk, tied to a desk in some rich man’s
office. I might have had some chance at happiness then!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head pityingly. “Oh no, that would never
do. That life would kill you. Your wings are powerful.
You must soar higher than the rest of us, even if it means
aching loneliness and solitude.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His mother’s words on Anne’s lips! There must be truth
in them, indeed! He uttered a sorrowful cry. “Oh Anne, I
simply cannot believe that this is the end. Tell me, must it
be so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded. Great tears coursed down her face. “Yes
Alexis, this is the end. You must stand by Claire now. I
shall love you more than ever for doing it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will kill me to part from you.” He pressed a tear-wet
cheek against hers. For an anguished moment, they
rocked to and fro in silent grief.</p>

<p class='c008'>She spoke at last, in a weak little voice, unlike her own.
“Better perhaps that we should part while we still love each
other. Then—then we shall always remember it so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A bitter-sweet smile twisted his lips. “Were you afraid
my love would get tepid? You were mistaken. If I didn’t
love you so consumingly, I couldn’t part with you now.
If this were only passion,” his voice broke, “I might have
been tempted to let things drift as they were until, until you
discovered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A beautiful look of comprehension crossed her face. She
pressed Alexis’ head to her bosom in a passion of tenderness.
“You are more noble than I dreamed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He groaned. “Not noble at all, only suffering, Anne.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me what you intend to do? Of course you will go
on your tour?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t ask me, I hardly know as yet, what I shall do
on my return. I will make the best arrangements for Claire
that I can. But I will never live with her as my wife, and
perhaps not even under the same roof.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Alexis, poor boy,” Anne felt him shudder as he lay
against her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does it hurt you to say good-by?” The whisper was
dragged from the anguish in his heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>A lump in her throat, she clasped him to her without a
word, and their lips met and clung in sorrowful communion.</p>

<p class='c008'>He bent over her and touched the emerald pendant about
her throat. “Keep it always in memory of me,” he whispered.
“Promise?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded. A rending pain, as of disruption racked her
to the bone. “I promise.” Her voice broke. She turned
away and flung herself face downwards on to the pillows.
“Go, please go, I cannot bear any more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stumbled to his feet and looked down upon her for
the final time, a lingering look, as if he were trying to
quench the thirst of the years to come in one consuming glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-by, my very, my only dearest. Try to forgive me
if you can. Remember that I love you, and always shall
love you to the very end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he went away.</p>

<p class='c008'>The door closed behind him with a soft, insistent finality
that resounded against Anne’s heart like the first clod of earth
upon a beloved coffin. She suddenly felt old and inexpressibly
weary, as if he had taken her youth away with him forever.
She broke into a fit of passionate weeping.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />“WILL YOU TAKE ME—”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Spring had taken possession of Florence. Its glamour,
its dewy freshness, lay over all. The pregnant earth
intoxicated with incense of new-born life.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the hillside, Anne’s garden was abloom. Hyacinths
and lilies, daffodils, jonquils and pansies, bordered the graveled
paths. Morning-glories crept along the rose-tinted
walls. In intricate designs, orderly brigades of tulips, flung
heavenwards their gorgeous cups. Lilac bushes showered
fragrance from all sides. The fountain, silent all winter,
gushed forth in renewed lilt. In its center, a marble cupid,
scarred and darkened with years, dimpled, perennially roguish.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the raised terrace, overlooking the valley, Anne was
pouring tea for Vittorio’s mother. <i>Petite, grande dame</i>, the
short snow-white hair curling tightly all over her head, the
Marchesa looked like an Eighteenth Century porcelain. About
the delicately wrinkled old throat coiled a necklace of pearls
as large and round as peas. A Chinese shawl, youthfully gay
and exotic, draped the frail shoulders. She was talking, as
usual, with great animation.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little pale in her yellow crèpe gown, Anne leaned back
in the Manila chair and listened. A subdued, rather weary,
little smile played about her lips. The old lady stopped her
chatter and scanned Anne’s face affectionately. The large
black eyes were very bright and uncannily piercing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter, Anne? You aren’t a bit like yourself
this spring. You seem a little fagged. Are you sure that
everything is right with you, dear child?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s smile brightened. “<i>Cara</i> Marchesa, of course I’m
all right. Why shouldn’t I be? Am I not always happy to
get back to my beloved Florence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchesa laughed happily, like a reassured child.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do love it, don’t you? You are a true daughter of
the Lily like myself. Just think, Anne, I haven’t been back
to America for almost forty years. And after Vittorio’s
hectic description of New York, I have no desire to go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a naughty lady,” Anne laughed. “An unpatriotic
little fraud! Nobody would dream you were an old New
Yorker, yourself, before your marriage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” the Marchesa smiled complacently. “They tell me
I am thoroughly Italianized. Frankly, the new America
would kill me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne laughed again. The Marchesa’s little affectation
was rather endearing. “I believe it would, Marchesa. You
belong in a garden like this, against a background of Tuscan
hills.” She waved her hand towards the terraced hillsides.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchesa nodded, pleased at the delicate compliment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Vittorio really likes New York, that is, some aspects
of it,” she said courteously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne shook her head with a dry little laugh. “Don’t try
to spare my feelings. He hated it. He was horribly bored
with us all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchesa’s eyes twinkled. She shook a coquettish finger
slightly crooked from rheumatism in Anne’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not bored with you, my dear. You cannot make me
believe that. You are the apple of his eye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne helped herself hastily to a buttered scone. “I’m
afraid the apple stuck in his throat more than once,” she
murmured with a nervous laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old woman looked at her wistfully. No, certainly,
Anne was not herself. What could be the matter? Some
love affair, perhaps?</p>

<p class='c008'>“When are you going to make us both happy?” The old
voice was very gentle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you still want me?” With averted head Anne fingered
the teacups.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More than ever, sweet child! I cannot bear to think
of poor Vittorio spending the rest of his life pottering about
musty old ruins. And that is what he will do if you won’t
have him, my dear. He refuses to look at any one else!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he loves ruins, doesn’t he?” Anne teased, her
equanimity somewhat restored.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchesa laughed ruefully. “Yes, he seems to have
an inextinguishable fondness for antiques, including his
mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps then, if I wait a little longer, I shall
acquire more value in his eyes, become more mellow, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wicked child! You speak of yourself as if you were a
cheese!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Speaking of cheese, that reminds me. I golfed with the
Principe this morning. You know he is in very bad odor here
at present? I felt quite devilish being seen with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some new scandal?” The black eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne shrugged. “A cinema actress, I believe.” She lighted
a cigarette and puffed at it delicately. “He had the temerity
to propose to me again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchesa’s foot tapped upon the bricks. “Impoverished
old wretch! I can’t bear to have you exposed to such
things, Anne. Why don’t you marry us, and protect yourself
against these adventurers?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Secure in her own immense fortune, the Marchesa serenely
felt her son to be above suspicion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne pretended to be immensely shocked. “The idea of
calling the Principe an adventurer. Why, his one foot in
the grave would break off if he could hear you. He is count
of this, marchese of that,” she flicked her ashes flippantly,
“and a Spanish Grandee to boot. I ought to know, he has
enumerated his titles to me often enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Marchesa cackled merrily. “I suggest his getting
out a catalogue for the benefit of American heiresses. Old
braggart! Why doesn’t he ask me? I’m nearer his age!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is going to invite you to his tennis tea on Sunday,”
giggled Anne. “Perhaps you can catch him on the rebound.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never say die! If I can’t have a daughter-in-law, I
might as well get me a husband!” The Marchesa rose to
her feet rheumatically. “But I must limp along now dear.
The sun is beginning to sink behind the <i>Duomo</i> and my old
bones will creak if I linger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne moved towards her quickly. “I hate to have you go,
dear lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Arm in arm, they strolled towards the balustrade and
leaned there silently. Dotted with occasional villas, the
terraced hillsides glowed russet. Dusky cypresses towered
beside stone walls. Olive trees, in gray-green uniforms
elbowed gayly-blossoming fruit trees, “Like soldiers out with
their sweethearts,” murmured Anne. “How Florence grows
upon one. What a personality she has! There is something
chaste and virginal about her, which is strange when you consider
her history. She is as unlike Rome or Venice as Botticelli
is different from Michael Angelo and Titian. But I put
it so badly!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see what you mean,” broke in the Marchesa. “Florence
will always be pre-Raphaelite. She is the Blonde Princess,
while Rome and Venice——” she hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are the wicked brunettes—the red-haired villainesses like
myself,” finished Anne with a laugh. “But it is beautiful.
I never get tired of the <i>Duomo</i>, especially from this distance,
do you? Near to, it resembles a mah jong set a little too
closely to suit me in flippant moods.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blasphemer!”</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of the rheumatism, they lingered while the setting
sun cast a ruddy glow over roofs and buildings and stained
the Arno pink, as it crawled beneath its bridges, and here
and there a window gleamed rose-colored. The crimson
dome of the cathedral resembled a mammoth ruby, its
columnar <i>campanile</i> soaring ethereally beside it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still arm in arm, the two women sauntered away from the
scene regretfully, and descended the short flight of steps
into the garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing with yourself to-night?” asked Anne
as they strolled down one of the graveled paths.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m looking forward to a perfect evening, child. Dinner
by the fire in the <i>saloto</i>, the companionship of Saint Simon,
unexpurgated. And you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne sighed. “Nothing. I refused a bridge. I wasn’t in
the mood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her sad face fretted the old Marchesa. What ailed the
girl? She certainly must be love-sick. Had Vittorio lost
out after all? Her son, she shrewdly suspected, was remaining
in Sicily at Anne’s request, for she had never known him
to miss a Florentine spring before. About to invite Anne
to join forces for the evening, she changed her mind abruptly.
If the child wished to work out her problem in solitude, she
herself ought to be the last to prevent her, especially if some
good should come out of it for Vittorio.</p>

<p class='c008'>They continued in silence to the end of the garden, where
a postern gate in the pink-tinted wall opened on to the Torrigiani
property. As the <i>Marchesa</i> passed through she turned
and gazed up into the other’s face. Tall and slim as a jonquil
in her yellow crêpe dress, Anne’s hair flamed in the setting
sun. The old woman’s eyes looked troubled as they rested
upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, how beautiful you are! I love to look at you!
If I were the typical old lady I’d be telling what a beauty I
was myself in my palmy days. I don’t seem to know my
cues at all. But as a matter of fact, I’m a better looking ruin
than I ever was girl! If I were more wily, too, and less wise,
I probably wouldn’t urge you quite so heartily, to marry my
only son. For there is danger in your beauty, child. But
years have taught me to appreciate danger. And I couldn’t be
so unkind as to deprive a son of mine of such a precious
stimulant.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With an enigmatic smile she raised herself on tiptoe and
pecked daintily at Anne’s chin. The younger woman gathered
her impulsively into her arms and squeezed her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You delicious old cynic! No wonder Vittorio adores you.
I do myself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A wistful expression crossed the delicate old face. “Be
good to us, my dear,” she whispered. “We need you terribly
in our house.” She turned gayly-shawled shoulders, and
trotted up the long avenue towards her villa.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne gazed after the small figure affectionately. Her
absent eyes swept the familiar gardens whose famous boxwood
hedges defined the paths with fantastic precision. Here
a strange, antediluvian beast, there a gigantic globe, so that
to the bird’s-eye view the gardens appeared like an enormous
chessboard with pawns at play. In the distance, from behind
a mass of towering cypresses, gleamed the villa, its splendid
façade flanked by a long flight of marble steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne closed the gate and walked back through her own
simple garden. She was anxious to reach the terrace again
before all vestige of the sunset should have disappeared, and
she mounted the steps with rapid feet. A cape over her
shoulders, she drew a chair up by the balustrade and sat there
while the henna-colored hills darkened to purple, then faded
into lavender, and a mist rolled up from the valley and curled
about the city like a smoking halo. Pretty soon a few lights
gradually emerged with the evanescent gleam of a flock of
fireflies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fireflies! Anne’s lips curled downward. She closed her
eyes behind smarting tears. Soon would return the season
of fireflies and roses. Would Vittorio be there to wander
arm in arm as of old in the <i>Viale</i>, beneath a golden moon,
while swarms of fireflies danced about them and the scent
of roses and verbena ascended to the stars? Anne did not
know. She had not been able to bring herself to the point
of meeting him again, although she had written of her definite
rupture with Alexis only a few weeks after it had taken
place. But her heart was still sore from the uprooting, and
the necessity for solitude was urgent as the primitive instinct
of a wounded animal. So she had begged Vittorio to be
patient a little while longer, to give her time to readjust
herself to the old life. And he had been generous as usual,
with an ecstatic undercurrent coursing beneath the sacrifice;
a feeling as of crisis reached and nearly overcome; a premonition
of future joys.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne had been quick to read this joy concealed between
the lines of his letters. But she had not had either the desire
or the heart to quench it. Her own unhappiness had made
her heart very tender towards Vittorio and she was inexpressibly
tired of struggling against the tide. Why not drift into
haven at last? If she were good for nothing else, at least,
she could make Vittorio happy. Alexis had taught her that,
and much besides. No longer the inhibited creature of her
first marriage, love and all it implied, no longer repelled her.
She had looked upon its naked beauty unashamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first bitterness of parting over, she scarcely knew in
what mood she found herself. A great lassitude had fallen
upon her. A weariness almost mortal. Although she had
realized from the beginning that rupture was inevitable, she
had not looked for it so soon, and when the blow fell it
stunned her. For days she had gone about her packing
numbly, and it was not until after her arrival in Florence that
she had been able to think about Alexis without tears, she
to whom weeping was strange and almost monstrous.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet she had never really loved him as a woman loves a
man upon whom she depends for her daily strength. He had
been like a dearly loved, temperamental child. Torn from
her arms, her tenderness was lost without him. Her heart
yearned to mother his sorrow. At times her need of him
was so desperate that she would have even welcomed a scene.
To feel the eager arms about her, to look upon the beautiful,
willful face, would have made up for all. However, in the
darkest hour, when the void he had left ached most intolerably,
Anne knew that their parting had all been for the best. Their
chances of enduring happiness had been so infinitesimal compared
to the odds against them. No, even now, hungry for
love and solitary as never before, she could still face facts
with a certain sturdy wisdom, a cynicism that amazed her, and
of which she was even a trifle ashamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>She found herself reading Vittorio’s letters with a growing
nostalgia for his comforting presence. His poise, his masculinity,
appealed to her more than ever before. Weary of leaning
upon herself, she longed to take refuge behind his strength.
How soothing, how comfortable, his untemperamental simplicity,
how genuinely lovable his personality. And besides
those qualities for which her fatigue yearned, he possessed rare
ability, brains, and a growing reputation that was rapidly
making him an outstanding figure amongst his colleagues.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne rose from her chair by the balustrade and groped
her way down into the garden. Yes, she mused, Vittorio was
a remarkable man. He deserved a better woman than herself.
She ought to be ashamed for having kept him waiting
so long. She strolled towards the house, whose lighted windows
flickered welcome from behind closed shutters. Should
she write to Vittorio to come at once? Perhaps? How happy
it would make the dear little Marchesa. Yes, she would write
to him now, at once, before the mood passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a resolute step she walked up to the terrace and entered
the villa, going directly to her desk in the library.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was perhaps an evasive little letter, after all, she thought,
as she stamped and gave it to the <i>contadine’s</i> boy to mail. But
it would fetch Vittorio, of that she was sure. Allowing three
or four days for it to reach him (it might just miss the boat
from Naples) she ought to be able to count upon seeing him
within ten days or perhaps even sooner. She went upstairs
and with the help of Regina changed into a loose, peplum-like
tea-gown. Supremely happy in her beloved Firenze, the
woman chattered volubly and flew about the large, austere
room, like a bright-eyed magpie. Amusement curved Anne’s
lips as she watched her. What boundless joy it would give
Regina when she herself became a Marchesa.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gleaming hair wound about her head like a copper helmet,
amber draperies clinging to the long, slim body, she wended
her way downstairs and into the dining room.</p>

<p class='c008'>After dinner she sat before the fire in the library, whose
crowded bookshelves gleamed like jewels in the light of the
flames. A volume of memoirs upon her knees, she gazed
into the blaze absently. About ten o’clock the gate-bell rang
and she heard a car drive into the courtyard. Perhaps the
Principe, or some young officer whom she was in the habit
of meeting at the Tennis Club in the <i>Cascine</i>. Not in the
mood for visitors, she rose and made for the stairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give my excuses, Sandro,” she commenced, as the old
butler appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she was too late, for the visitor had followed close upon
the man’s heels. Decidedly annoyed, she turned and faced
the intruder, a courteous smile upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>If Anne had been a frail woman, she might have fainted.
As she was, she came nearer to it than ever in her life before.
The color drained from her face. She stared with dilated
eyes, as a slim, tall man traversed the distance between them
in a few short strides.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, I have come back. Will you take me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Falling at her feet, Alexis encircled her knees with relentless
young arms.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />CLAIRE’S CHILD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Anne led Alexis into the library, and fell into a chair
before the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What does this mean? Have you left Claire after all?”
Her widened eyes stared at Alexis coldly. So all his good
resolutions had meant just nothing? The weakling strain
would out. She might have guessed it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But his gaze met hers unflinchingly. “Claire is dead,”
he whispered. The words issued from pale lips almost
inaudibly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hands pressed against the arms of her chair, Anne started
up. Her rising scream was subdued to a whisper. “Claire
dead!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded dumbly. Throwing himself into a chair, he
cupped his face in trembling fingers. “Yes, Anne, Claire is
dead. And I have killed her as surely as if I’d stuck a knife
into her, or put poison into her food.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s hands flew instinctly to her mouth to check a cry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” Was it possible that——?</p>

<p class='c008'>His misery-laden eyes encountered the question in hers
without comprehending its horrible significance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The child. My child,” he replied with tragic simplicity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” Anne leaned her head against the chair-back. She
closed her eyes while a species of lucid swoon swept over her.
So Claire was dead. They had killed her between them. She
and Alexis had killed a woman. For if Alexis was guilty,
so was she. Was she not the indirect cause of the girl’s
misery? Might not Alexis have gone back to Claire if it had
not been for herself? That was problematical and open to
doubt, so her uncanny lucidity informed her. But the fact
remained they had killed her between them. And yet the
very first time that Anne had seen Claire she already bore
within herself the seeds of death. Tragic germ of life, that
contains death! Poor, poor Claire!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Claire,” she moaned beneath her breath almost
unconsciously.	“And—the child?” she faltered, sturdily
defiant of her fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank God.” Anne’s face was suddenly wet with tears.
“Tell me about it.” From a gulf of despair, Anne’s voice
smote upon his misery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was horrible. Her face, her poor little dead face! I
cannot sleep at night for seeing it.” He wrung tortured
hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne shuddered. “Tell me about it,” she whispered
relentlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He fixed his eyes upon her petrified face with a groan.
“Oh, Anne, must I tell you everything? Can’t I spare you
anything at all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me everything. I can bear it if you can.” Her
pupils narrowed in an agony of pity, as they fell upon his
white face.</p>

<p class='c008'>He continued in a monotonous voice that muffled his suffering
as a heavy mist conceals the lip of a chasm. “I was
in Chicago when I received the telegram. I cancelled my
engagements and rushed back to New York on the next
train. But it was too late—Claire was dead.” Head heavy
on his chest, his lids drooped leadenly over a waxy face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go on.” Anne’s voice was thick with tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I went to the apartment. Dr. Elliott met me at the
door. He was in his shirt-sleeves.” His voice choked and
he was silent for a moment. “You don’t know Dr. Elliott,
but he was Claire’s friend as well as her doctor. He—he loved
Claire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne showed her astonishment. Was it possible that
between them they had driven the child to such cheap
consolation? He sensed her terror.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Anne, Elliott was not Claire’s lover. He merely loved
her. He would have liked to marry her if she had been willing
to divorce me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see. Poor man!” Anne’s lips grew paler.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis continued in the same emotionless tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, poor wretch. He is a fine fellow, and would have
made her happy if it hadn’t been for me. So you understand,
of course, how much he hates me, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, it is only natural.” Her voice was warm with
pity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis glanced up at her with pathetic gratitude. “He met
me at the door. He gave me one terrible look, a look that I
shall never forget, and said, ‘Your wife is dead.’ I—I don’t
know exactly what I did, but I think I leaned against the
wall and I must have looked odd, for he cried out, ‘Christ,
this is no time to faint, man. Your wife is dead, I tell you,
and you’ve got to face it. It’s your own neglect that has
killed her!’ Those are the very words he used. They are
branded into my brain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped short with a moan. Anne uttered a cry of
pity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor boy, how you have suffered! But go on, I must
know it all. That is the only way I can help you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dark with pain and compassion, her eyes endowed him with
renewed force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He told me horrors, Anne, but I deserved them all. He
said there was no reason why it should not have been a normal
birth, except that Claire had been so weakened by unhappiness
that she simply didn’t have the physical stamina to pull her
through. And he added that she didn’t want to live, that
she felt all along that she wouldn’t. That’s why she refused
to go to the hospital. She couldn’t bear the thought of dying
there. Anne, think of it. Think of poor Claire, knowing she
was going to die, and planning for it like that. Isn’t it too
pitiful?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it is horrible,” Anne whispered, “and that is probably
what killed her. She was so sure she was going to die,
that she made no effort to help herself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is what Elliott said. There wasn’t much he didn’t
say. When he had finished, he swept by me and out of the
house and I haven’t seen him since, excepting——” he hesitated
painfully, “at the funeral.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne winced. The funeral, how heartrending! She had
never thought of that, somehow. But of course there had
had to be one. She avoided his eyes that brimmed with
knowledge of such horrors.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall not speak of that.” His voice fluted dangerously.
“After Elliott left I—I almost ran away myself. But the
nurse came into the hall and seemed to expect me to go
in and see Claire. I didn’t want to, Anne. It was the most
difficult thing I ever did in my life. I somehow felt as if
I hadn’t the right to take advantage of her helplessness. But
the nurse couldn’t know that, of course, so I followed her
into the room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He paused and shaded his eyes with quivering fingers.
“Anne, she was beautiful. She looked rested as she used to
when we were children together. Her hair was braided in
two plaits on either side of her face. On one of her tiny
hands gleamed the wedding ring. After that first glimpse I
couldn’t take my eyes off it. It seemed so pathetic, somehow.
So tragic to have her wear it to the very end—and after. It
wrenched at my heart. I fell down by the bedside and cried.
Afterwards,” he faltered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne prompted him tenderly. “Afterwards?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Afterwards, when I was in the hall again, the nurse
asked me if I didn’t want to see the child. I—I had forgotten
all about it! Just to think of it, Anne, I hadn’t even
remembered to ask if it had lived. My own child! What
kind of a brute do you think I am?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merely a puzzled and a frightened one, poor Alexis.
Certainly not the monster you imagine. Come, tell me about
the baby, dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her compassion fell like oil upon his wounded soul. He
loved her for it and for the beautiful calm with which she
suppressed her own sorrow, which he sensed strongly beneath
his own piercing misery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She left me for a moment and returned with a bundle
in her arms. The bundle whimpered a little like—like a
sick kitten. I was afraid to look, but the nurse thrust it under
my eyes and I had to. It was a very ugly baby, Anne. The
little face was all screwed up. Pale and puny, not fat and
red like the babies in pictures. It made me a little sick at
first. I didn’t want to touch it. It was sort of uncanny with
its great, hazy eyes staring out at me. However, she laid
it in my arms and I had to hold it, for fear it might fall on
the ground and break if I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he stopped for a moment, Anne smiled through tears.
How very masculine, even the most feminine of men can be
under certain conditions.</p>

<p class='c008'>A new and softer expression spread over his tired face. The
eyes acquired an exalted expression. He continued. “Then an
odd thing happened, Anne, a very odd thing! As I held him
away from me, he stirred in my arms. I could feel his little
feet kick my side, and a tiny fist, like an unopened bud suddenly
beat against my breast. A hand, knocking at my
heart, the hand of my son! It sent a thrill coursing all over
me, Anne. I bent over and kissed the pale, pathetic forehead.
And as I met the cloudy eyes, so full of sadness and
mystery, I knew that I loved him. And I vowed that I
would make it all up to him, cherish him, bring him up to
be as different from myself as possible, that he might be both
happy and sane. Then, immediately, while he was still in my
arms and I could feel him stir against my heart, I thought of
you, Anne. I thought of you and knew that you would help
us. You, who are so strong, so beautifully sane yourself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis rose and threw himself at Anne’s feet. He seized
her unresisting hands and covered them with kisses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Anne, take pity on us! Love us if you can. We need
you so terribly!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She caressed his head with compassionate hands. “Yes, dearest,
yes.” Her eyes were tragic as she listened. “We need
you so terribly.” The words of the Marchesa! She had used
them eons ago, when this self-same afternoon was young.
Poor Marchesa! Poor Vittorio! They would suffer if they
were to lose her. But not like Alexis. Alexis and a baby!
Combination of helplessness! If she, Anne, were to forsake
them, what would become of them at all? And she owed
it to Claire. It was the only reparation she could make for
the injuries she had been forced to inflict upon her. To look
after Alexis, to cherish him as the dead girl had longed to do
herself so that his marvelous art might not be stilled by
sorrow, to give her child, poor mite, the love and happiness its
mother had craved and never received. Anne’s path seemed
to lie clear before her tear-washed eyes. Once more, Vittorio
would have to be sacrificed. This time forever. But he was
strong. His grief would never break him. He would make
of it a staff to further progress. But Alexis—for Alexis, her
refusal might mean return to that dark Limbo from which she
had rescued him once before. And to that fate, so much more
bitter than death, Anne could never condemn him.</p>

<p class='c008'>She pressed her cheek against the head that lay so humbly
upon her knees. She raised his face and looked down into
the tragic young eyes. A long look, a giving look, a look
that poured divine essence of compassion from her very soul,
in a sort of spiritual transfusion, until the face between her
hands became suffused with rapture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No Alexis, do not be afraid, I shall not desert you now.
Nothing but your own will can ever separate us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked up at her with the humility of a dumb beast.
“Does this mean you are really going to marry me, Anne?”
he asked in hushed tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded gravely. “If you wish it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The rapture on his face brimmed over into tremulous
laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, Anne!” He was about to take her in his arms,
but she repulsed him with gentle dignity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Alexis, not now dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He understood. A subdued expression veiling his joy, he
sat down quietly at a little distance. Anne looked at him
gratefully. After all, she could always count upon his
delicacy, which was a great comfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is the child?” she inquired, making an effort to
shoulder her new responsibilities.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked pleased. “In the apartment in Gramercy Park.
He has a trained nurse, and is getting along very well. I had
a cable yesterday. Oh, Anne, will you try to love him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne smiled through the leaden lassitude that had suddenly
fallen upon her. “I shan’t have to try. He is little and
helpless and yours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, my beautiful one, my angel!”</p>

<p class='c008'>This time she did not evade the effusion, but resigned
herself to the hungry young arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much later, after Alexis had gone, and the fire had smouldered
into a mound of white dust, Anne went to the telephone,
and sent Vittorio the wire which was to nullify so completely
her summons of a few short hours ago.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />“PITY THAT PAINS”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Anne’s villa delighted Alexis, especially the small music
room with its frescoed walls and paucity of furniture.
It was, he said, the ideal room for music, and they spent their
evenings there and many afternoons.</p>

<p class='c008'>To-day, an outburst of spring rain had driven them gustily
indoors. It fell from the skies like a sable veil through which
smiling hillsides showed ashen like a woman in mourning. In
the garden the cypresses dripped heavily. Water foamed down
the gutters in amber cataracts.</p>

<p class='c008'>A shower of slanting missiles, the rain hurled itself against
the windows, drumming upon the panes with the beat of a
thousand nervous fingers. Anne shivered a little. From a
stool at her side Alexis looked up into her face anxiously. It
was pale, and the large eyes gleamed from out dark circles.
He took her relaxed hand and stroked it tenderly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You look tired, dearest one. Aren’t you well this
afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My head aches a little.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was palpable to Alexis that her smile came with an effort.
He laid his cheek against her hand with a low, crooning caress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor darling! What could have caused it? I’ve never
known you to have one before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She passed a hand over her forehead in the futile gesture
that accompanies headache. “I have only had one or two in
my whole life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her tired smile went to his heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think brought it on?” he persisted. “Have
I worn you completely out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not, silly boy!” The over-brilliant eyes
hovered upon him restlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what is it then?” Anxiety rendered him brusque.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose it was my visit to the Marchesa this morning.
It wasn’t an easy thing to do, Alexis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Telling her about us, you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded wearily. “You see, she has hoped for years that
I would marry her son, and it was rather a blow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor old lady, of course it was. But didn’t she know
that you had no intention of marrying him anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne avoided the searching eyes, with elaborate carelessness.
“Yes, but so long as I remained single, she always felt there
was a chance of my changing my mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, poor old thing! I don’t blame her for being upset
at losing you. If I were she, I’d want to commit murder.
Was she nasty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No-o.” Anne frowned a little. In her delicate way
the Marchesa had certainly been a trifle ironic. But you
couldn’t blame her for that, as Anne had not felt it incumbent
upon herself to tell the truth in its entirety. Yes, she
had been a little cutting and the sting of her words lingered
in Anne’s heart. Particularly the inference about the nursemaid
wives of erratic geniuses. But the pinched look about
her mouth, the added pallor upon the frail ivory face had
more than excused her. If one chose to wound one’s dearest
friends by indulging in what must seem like inexplicable
freaks, one must suffer the consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You seem a little uncertain?” During Anne’s silence,
Alexis’ eyes had darkened with renewed suspicion.</p>

<p class='c008'>His persistence troubled her. She shrugged fatigued shoulders.
“Let’s forget it, dear. What’s the good of rubbing
it in? The Marchesa took my news a little harder than
necessary perhaps. Our conversation was a very unhappy, miserable
affair. You see, I couldn’t tell her everything. And
so she doesn’t quite understand. She merely thinks I’ve lost
my silly old head over a handsome violinist who will some day
leave me high and dry for a fresher and prettier woman. Her
point of view is natural, quite refreshingly cynical in fact.
She suggested I indulge my infatuation by a temporary liaison
rather than in marriage, which couldn’t fail to be fatal!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She burst into a hysterical little laugh, which Alexis resented
furiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wicked old witch! And I was sorry for her a little while
ago!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He drew the stool to Anne’s knees, and leaned his weight
against her. “You do love and trust me don’t you, dearest?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course. Why not?” She used a light tone purposely.
Her fatigue would permit of no other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve never looked at any other woman but you, Anne. I
never even notice women on the street. In my audiences they
are just so many blank discs that come to life under my music,
and then melt back again into the common mass. No, I
shall never be a woman-chasing man. You and my music
and the poor little child whom between us, we’re going to
make a happy little child, will more than fill my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His enraptured expression struck Anne with a pang. Poor
Alexis, there was so much more good in him than he had
ever been given credit for. That he was neither light nor
sensual she had surmised from the beginning. But even she
had never plumbed the depths of nobility that lay concealed
beneath the child-like and difficult temperament. Perhaps,
after all, the future might turn out to be less dark than she
feared. She threw her arms about his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re going to be happy, aren’t we?” Her voice
unconsciously pleaded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eyes closed, he snuggled against her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Happy? I shall be exultant as a god. As for you, you’re
such an angel that my joy may be enough for you! But I
shall try, how I shall try to make you happy, too. How
proud I shall be of my wife. When people see you sitting
in a box at my concerts, they will ask who is that radiant
creature? And the answer will be ‘Mme. Alexis Petrovskey.’
‘Is she not wonderful?’ Men will go mad over you. They
will want to fight duels over you with me. But I shall laugh
in their faces. For you will be mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silly boy!” Her hand caressed his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In another six weeks we will be in Paris together. Anne
and music and Paris! I don’t dare think of it! I’m afraid
something will happen, that I’ll burst of joy perhaps first!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ought to be able to count on lasting through the next
few weeks without asking too much of the gods,” laughed
Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know. They are said to be jealous! But enough
gloom! Do you still like your ring dear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m crazy about it. It’s the most beautiful I have ever
seen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out her hand and they admired the ring with
rather comical gravity. An enormous emerald cut square
and set in a delicate lacework of diamonds and platinum,
it etherealized the white hand to the point of fragility.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My collection of emeralds ought to be complete. First
my bracelet, then the pendant, and now my ring.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He protested scornfully. “Complete, I should say not!
I intend to hang ropes of emeralds all over you yet, when I’m
really famous,” he boasted with boyish glee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Until I fall dead beneath their weight, like the princess
in the fairy tale!” Her arm dropped from about his shoulder
wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a remorseful look at her pale face, he left her and
walked to the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look, the rain has stopped. It was only a shower after
all. The hillsides are smiling again. And the garden is as
fresh and dewy as a pretty woman after her bath. Shall we
go out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened the French window and they stepped out on
to the flagged terrace. Polished by rain, diamond-studded, in
the late afternoon sun, the garden sent up renewed incense,
a symphony of rare fragrance, that mounted into the air like
music.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It reminds me of one of Liszt’s rhapsodies,” said Alexis, his
fingers wielding an imaginary bow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some day I shall compose a rhapsody of my own and call
it, ‘To a Tuscan Garden.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, but next month when the roses are out, that is the
most enchanting of all,” sighed Anne dreamily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we shall not be here then,” he retorted. “We shall
already be on our way to Paris—I mean to Paradise!” He
laughed unsteadily. “Anne, think of it. Think of you and
me alone in the <i>wagon-lit</i>. Won’t it be deliciously improper?
I shall boast before the guards. It will be my wife desires
this, and that. ‘Please close the window. My wife doesn’t
like a draught!’” He was so comic in his pantomime that
Anne laughed until the tears came.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You young rogue!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He pressed her arm against his side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How is the poor head, dear? How would you like to
lie down in the hammock and let me play to you, while the
sun sinks back of the city, and sets the old <i>Duomo</i> on fire!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a Neronic inspiration!” She smiled with an effort.
“But dear, would you think it beastly of me if I sent you
home now? My head is really rather bad and if I don’t make
an effort to get rid of it, it may get the better of me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Immediately, he was full of remorse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not. Why didn’t you send me packing a long
time ago? I’ll run right along and you go to bed like a
good girl. Shall I see you in the morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weren’t we going to the Uffizi? I know you detest
sightseeing as much as I do. But there are some things you
simply mustn’t miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked doubtful. “But are you fit to go, darling?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed I am. All I need to put me on my feet is a good
night’s rest. To-morrow I shall be right as rain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if you aren’t, I’ll come up and nurse you myself.
Shall I take my violin back with me, or leave it here as
usual?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, leave it. You won’t need it to-night. And it’s
safer here than at the hotel. Well, good-by. You’re a dear to
put up with all my pains and aches.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such dear aches and pains, all caused by my own brutal
self!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out her hands. He kissed the palms lingeringly,
and then swung down the terrace towards the courtyard, where
his car was waiting by the tall iron gates. Slim, flexible
as a steel blade, small shapely head, aureoled in the setting
sun, he trod the air like a young god.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne looked after him wistfully. As he disappeared around
the angle of the house, fatigue mounted about her in dizzy
waves, sucked her down, engulfed her in a dark, pulsating
embrace, like the swirl of black waters.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>Brilliant afternoon faded into dark, moonless night. Gun-metal
clouds obscured, one by one, the beckoning stars. A
breeze, warm and sweet-smelling as the breath of cattle,
stirred in the tops of the trees.</p>

<p class='c008'>From her deck upon the garden terrace, Anne watched the
clouds as, with swollen sails, they scurried like miraged galleons
upon an inverted sea. Her headache eased, it had left behind
a trail of lassitude. She lay back in her chair, too weary
for thought, spent to the point of serenity, at truce with an
unsubstantial world.</p>

<p class='c008'>When footsteps cut crisply upon the brick stairway, she
did not even trouble to turn her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that you, Alexis?” she called languidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vittorio’s voice broke upon her lethargy with the abruptness
of a stone thrown into a stagnant pool.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, it is I, Vittorio.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Pierced as by a blade, her numbness fell from her like
a mantle. She rose, and leaning against the balustrade, gave
vent to a thin cry. “I told you not to come!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But surely, you didn’t expect to be obeyed?” Etched
against the sombre heavens, Vittorio loomed disproportionately
large. He approached and seized her hands almost roughly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My mother says you are going to marry this Petrovskey.
Tell me it isn’t true, Anna <i>mia</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.” She made a feeble effort to withdraw her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I thought he had a wife already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She—she died a few weeks ago. Won’t you please
let go my hands?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His grasp tightened. “How do you know he is telling you
the truth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She threw back her head proudly. The curve of her throat
shone through the dusk like a white pillar. “Alexis is not a
liar!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Vittorio laughed grimly. It was worse than he had feared.
“But you cannot mean to marry him. He is entirely out of
your class, an artist, a Bohemian. If you cannot protect
yourself from such people, I must do it for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne succeeded in wrenching away her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have not asked for your protection, Vittorio Torrigiani.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, <i>madonna mia</i>, but you need it. You suddenly decide
to throw away your life and expect me to sit calmly by. I
warn you I am desperate. I cannot permit this sacrilege.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sacrilege? You call this sacrilege? If you had used
that word a few months ago you might have come nearer
to the truth. But now——!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He broke in quickly. “Ah, that was different. That was
only for the time being. This is for life. That was a whim,
a condescension. Not to be taken seriously like marriage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I took it seriously,” her voice was quick with reproach.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know you did, and I loved you for it, although it nearly
broke my heart. To feel that you belonged to another man,
that you had given yourself of your own free will was the
most fearful hell I hope to ever have to undergo. But this
is ten times worse. It isn’t only that I am going to lose you
forever, that is bad enough, God knows, but to know that you
will be miserable, unhappy, completely out of your sphere.
Ah, that is more than I can bear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laid her hand upon his sleeve pleadingly. “But if I
can bear it, if I feel that it is the right thing to do? Won’t
that help at all, Vittorio?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how can I know that you are not sacrificing yourself
again? There is something mysterious about this. You
are keeping something back, Anne.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned from him with a hopeless shrug and leaned
her elbows on the balustrade.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s nothing mysterious about it, Vittorio. Alexis is
alone in the world. He needs me and I am fond of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went towards her impulsively. “Fond of him! You
call that love? Fond, is that a word to build a marriage
upon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m only quoting you. Haven’t you told me many times
that love wasn’t necessary to a happy marriage?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I did I was lying and you knew it, my Anne, or you
would have taken me a dozen times over. And I was always
patient because I felt that love would come to you finally.
And lately, I was so happy, happier than for years. Your
letters were so wonderful. I could hear you calling to me
between the lines. I felt the time was rapidly approaching
when you would awaken to your need of me. Oh, Anne,
you’re not a capricious woman. You couldn’t have written to
me like that just out of caprice. I feel I have the right to
ask for an explanation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned towards him blindly as he leaned beside her on
the parapet. Their groping hands met and clung. “You have
a right to all I can tell you, Vittorio.” Her fingers trembled
in his strong clasp. “But there isn’t much to say. When I
wrote you I thought I was free. And—then he came—and
I discovered that I had made a mistake. So I telegraphed to
you not to come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The grasp upon her hand tightened nervously. “You mean
you discovered that it was he and not I whom you loved after
all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps,” her voice came muffled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But don’t you know, dear heart?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fingers in his fluttered. “Yes—I know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The words were almost inaudible. And he was forced to
lean close in order to hear them at all. Then almost before
she knew it, his arms were about her. His lips rained kisses
upon her averted face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Carissima</i>, it is I whom you love. I, Vittorio! How
many times shall I have to tell it to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The exultant voice deafened her. Giddy, on the point of
defeat, she pushed him away with the palms of her hands, and
fell into a chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t. Don’t.” Face hidden in her fingers, she began to
sob weakly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes. It is the only way to save you from yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Falling on his knees beside the chair, he removed the hands
from her tear-wet face. “Now—tell me all,” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>She faltered out the pitiful story of Claire’s death and
Alexis’s remorse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you see how he needs me,” she ended.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I—I need you too,” he insisted desperately, crushed
by the tragedy of it all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not the way he does,” she interposed. “Oh, Vittorio, I
have promised. I cannot break my word even——” her voice
faltered—“even for you! Nothing but Alexis’ own will can
ever separate us now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He groaned. “But you are not happy. You do not love
him. You love me. Even he wouldn’t ask you to keep your
word if he knew that,” he said miserably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he doesn’t know. He doesn’t dream that I don’t love
him, poor boy. I’d rather tear myself in pieces than have him
guess. He has been so unhappy, so miserable!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Anne, doesn’t my unhappiness, my misery, mean as
much to you as his?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned an anguished face towards him, laying her hands
upon his shoulders. “You know what it means to me,” she
gasped. “I—I love you, Vittorio.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His arms closed about her frantically. “This is horrible.
You say you love me and yet you are going to marry another
man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have given my word,” she whispered, against his heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were silent for a moment, while the perfumed breeze
rustled in the tree-tops and played with the vines upon the wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What was that?” exclaimed Anne, starting up nervously.
A new sound, like a stealthy footstep had risen from the path
beneath them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing, dearest.” Vittorio rose and peered over the parapet,
into the black pit that was the garden, “Nothing at all.
It must have been a fallen branch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For a moment I thought it was Alexis,” she breathed,
hand on bounding heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>He strolled back to her. “Ah, you see, he frightens you
already. He is in the back of your mind constantly. Give
him up before it is too late, <i>cara</i>. If you don’t, I shall have
to go to him myself and tell him the truth. If he doesn’t
release you then, he is a cad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stood up and faced him. “If you do that, I shall never
see you again. It would be the act of a fiend. It would kill
every spark of love that I ever felt for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, Anne, are you asking me to give you up again?”
He stretched famished arms towards her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She wrung her hands against a sudden, smiting anguish, that
left her weak and trembling. “Yes——” she whispered.
“Vittorio!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She slipped into his outstretched arms with a strangled cry.
Their lips met, lingered, then parted unsatisfied.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>Only a few words, a woman’s smothered cry, but sufficient
to quench forever Alexis’ joy. Only a few words in fewer
moments, but enough to send tottering the entire foundation of
his being, which less than a minute before had towered to the
limitless heavens.</p>

<p class='c008'>A pæan upon the lips, nectar in his veins, he had approached
the terrace as if on air. Anne’s head was better, so Regina
had told him. She had gone out into the garden, was sitting
alone under the scattered stars. How surprised she would be
when the notes of his violin stole upon her through the night!
He would play the Canzonetta from Tchaikowsky’s Concerto,
the one they both loved the best. It was just the thing for a
night like this. A heavy, mysterious night. A night weighted
with warm perfume and the promise of hidden rapture. A
quivering, mischievous smile upon his lips, he had tiptoed to the
bottom of the terrace. Violin tucked beneath his chin, bow
raised, ready to sweep the strings, he had suddenly paused.
From the terrace above a man’s voice had cut into the silence.
Alexis held his breath. So Anne was not alone after all? A
caller, some unknown man had chosen to-night of all nights
to make her a visit. How annoying! And yet how absurd of
him to be upset. Why shouldn’t Anne have a visitor? It was
the most natural thing in the world. Only a monopolist like
himself could possibly grudge it her. Besides, it would be a
good opportunity to become acquainted with one of Anne’s
friends. He decided to mount the steps and meet the intruder
as cordially as possible, when the sound of Anne’s voice,
vibrant and agitated, had reached his ears, and he had listened
in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he doesn’t know, he doesn’t dream that I don’t love
him, poor boy!” Then the man’s voice, pleading, but masterful.
“But, Anne, doesn’t my unhappiness mean as much to
you as his?”</p>

<p class='c008'>That answer of Anne’s! Those flaying words that laid bare
Alexis’ soul! That confession of love, which had undermined
his whole structure of being!</p>

<p class='c008'>And the entire horror had passed within the space of a
moment. The air still vibrated with Anne’s words, was heavy
with their import. Stunned, Alexis had crawled out of hearing
and leaned against the base of the terrace. Dismembered,
leaden, his limbs rocked beneath him sickeningly. Presently,
when the strength flowed back into them again, he would
creep away to the gates where his car was waiting. Meanwhile,
he must be very silent. A single, uneven breath, a
smothered sob might betray him. And they must not guess his
presence until he was beyond reach or recall. To steal away
was the least he could do. He would steal away out of Anne’s
life, like a thief who has stolen another man’s treasure, and
then come back surreptitiously, to return it. He, Alexis, was
a thief. He had tried to take what did not belong to him.
He was an unsuccessful thief, moreover, for Anne’s love had
never been his. From the bottomless abyss, he knew it now if
never before. The woman who had lain in his arms, whose
body he had called his own, had never belonged to him at all.
She had remained remote as a condescending goddess. Pitiful,
without doubt, but fundamentally untouched. “And yet it
is her pity that pains me most.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne, his Anne, he had made her suffer! She was suffering
at this moment, only a few feet away. God, how he hated
himself! He must get away immediately, before the sight of
her weakened him, the beloved voice shattered his resolution to
tatters. Violin clasped mechanically to his breast, he crept
along the wall and cut across the grass to the gates. They
were still ajar and he slipped through to his car unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haggard, unkempt, he entered his hotel and regardless of
curious glances, strode to the bureau and secured his berth on
the midnight express for Paris.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two hours later he was on his way.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he had left behind him a letter for Anne. A taciturn,
incoherent letter that strove to conceal the pain that he knew
would wound her so cruelly. She must not be sad for him.
She must not blame herself at all. It was not her fault that
he had overheard her confession. Above all, she must not be
afraid that he would do anything desperate like killing himself.
Those old, unbalanced days were gone forever. He
must live for his child now and his music. He prayed her
not to write or to follow him, as out of her immense pity and
charity he was afraid she might be tempted to do. But to
give him this chance to prove himself a man to them both.
He had played with her magnanimity for the last time. He
hoped that she would forgive him all the suffering he had so
stupidly caused her. And finally, he begged her to think of
him sometimes and to keep his gifts for the sake of the great
love he would always bear her.</p>

<p class='c008'>An incoherent letter, every word of which revealed to Anne
his bleeding hurt. With anguished eyes, she visualized,
relived his agony. Saw him as he crouched beneath the terrace
and overheard her confess her love to Vittorio. Followed on
his mad ride back to the city. Stood behind him while he
labored over the scrawl which was to conceal from her his
pain, his utter desolation. Accompanied and sat beside him in
the <i>wagon-lit</i> as he steamed put of Florence, out of her life.
That same <i>wagon-lit</i> of which he had spoken so joyously only
yesterday. That <i>wagon-lit</i> he had hoped to share with her as
his companion, but in which he had been destined to ride alone.
Behind scalding tears, she saw him throw himself onto his
berth, watched him as he lay wide-eyed and motionless into
the dawn. Passed with him into the future, as exalted,
fawned-upon, his child and his violin by his side, he disappeared
over the horizon and out of her sight, a pathetic,
solitary figure.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Urged by a placid breeze, the small boat sped forward
with the graceful glide of a swan, its henna-sail reflected
in the rippleless waters like tarnish on green bronze. Almost
grazing the lush banks it passed the large hotels on the mainland
and skirted the island, where the gardens of the villas
sprawl luxuriantly down to the Nile.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne settled herself in the stern with a sigh of sheer joy.
Beneath a large sun hat, her shadowed eyes looked like shining
green pools in a dark forest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wail of shadoof, song of sakieh, how I love it,” she
murmured. She gazed upon the shore, where polished brown
bodies bent rhythmically over their world-old task. “If you
hadn’t taken a holiday this year, Vittorio, I don’t know how I
should ever have borne it. Let me see, it’s three years since
we were last in Assuan, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but you know you hated to leave the boys, Anne. As
for me, I wouldn’t have enjoyed it without you.” His eyes
rested upon her fondly. “How are you enjoying your second
honeymoon, <i>cara</i>?” He slipped a proprietary arm about her
slim waist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne laughed happily and looked askance at the gorgeously-appareled
dragoman sitting in the bow with the two sailors.
“Really, Vittorio, after ten years of the matrimonial yoke,
your devotion deserves honorable mention.” One eye still
upon the dragoman, she squeezed his hand surreptitiously.
“Will you never remember you’re married to an old woman?
I’ll be forty-three in a few months. Heigh-ho!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Above the mock-tragic sigh her smile was divinely careless,
divinely assured. The smile of a woman who knows in every
fiber of her being that she is loved. And indeed the years had
changed Anne almost not at all. A trifle less slim, her beauty
had deepened and perfected in the mold. Brilliant, undimmed,
her hair shone like beaten copper beneath the
drooping brim of the leghorn.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little lined, quite gray, certainly more distinguished than
before, Vittorio pressed against her side. “Forty-three! Do
you call that a great age, foolish one? You are fishing! You
know perfectly well that you are as beautiful as ever. If I
were jealous, I shouldn’t have a moment’s peace with the raft
of men you always have about you, at home in Florence—and
the idle brutes at the hotel here, who seem to have nothing to
do but to ogle you from the time you appear in the morning
until you disappear at night with my most fortunate self.
Some day I expect to be murdered by one of your miserable
victims!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old villain, if one of your revered colleagues could hear
you now! The celebrated Torrigiani, discoverer of famous
relics of infamous royalties, making love to his own wife as
they float along the Nile. Why, even the Pharaohs would
laugh at you for an old-fashioned frump, although it couldn’t
have been such a terrible task to be faithful to as many wives
as they had!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As they neared the end of the long island, the branching
Nile curved broadly. Myriads of tiny islands like diving
seals glutted the waters. Beyond on the shore, the green
stopped abruptly, and rolling amber sands stretched palely
golden beneath a sky of melted turquoise. Girdled by palms,
shod with roses, a pink villa nestled within its garden. From
the awninged terrace the sound of faint music wafted upon
the scented air, rose above the wail of the shadoof.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne and Vittorio looked at each other in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A violin,” Anne murmured, and listened. The exquisite
tones hummed an air unfamiliar to her ears, an air at once
heart-breaking and unspeakably beautiful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How lovely!” A shade of sadness crept over her face.
“The man certainly knows how to play,” she clasped her
hands closely. The sound of a violin still moved her to the
marrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gorgeous dragoman turned about abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, <i>Madame</i>, ze music please ’er? Zat ees ze mad
Englissman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The mad Englishman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, yes. ’E is great <i>artiste</i>. But ’e is seek, very seek.
He ’ave ze consump’, you know. Eet ees very bad. ’E spit
zee blood. ’E seet all day outside ’e’s ’ouse and play ze veolon,
and never speak to no ones. ’E’s man, ’e good friend mine, ’e
tell me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hands still clasped together nervously, Anne leaned forward.
“What is his name?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Ees name? I forget eet. Very strange for Englis name.
More like ze <i>Russie</i>. Pe, Pet, but I forgot how eet finis!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Pale beneath her large hat, Anne prodded him almost
angrily. “Try to think, Abdul. Is—is it Petrovskey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The dragoman beamed. “Ah, yes, zat ees eet. Per’aps
<i>Madame</i>, she ’ave ’eard of ’eem?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Speechless, Anne nodded. Her long white throat worked
spasmodically. Vittorio put an arm about her quivering
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Cara mia</i>, perhaps it is not the same man at all. Do not
grieve, dearest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head, while the music rose to a crescendo,
and stopped momentarily. “I’m almost sure it must be,
Vittorio. Don’t you remember reading in the paper over a
year ago that he had retired from the concert stage on account
of ill health? And that I wanted to write to him, but decided
that after all these years it would be better not to?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Vittorio nodded. A look of suffering crept into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps you are right, Anne. Maybe it is Petrovskey.
What do you want to do? Would you like to get off and
see him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at her husband with startled eyes. Was she to
see Alexis again after all these years? Did she have the
courage to reopen old wounds? He might be horribly changed
from the boy she had known. Illness plays such cruel tricks
with one. And she wanted so frightfully to remember him as
she had seen him last, when he left her garden over ten years
ago. Then his beauty had been triumphant. Aureoled by
setting sun, his indelible image had stamped itself upon her
memory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vittorio’s eyes rested upon her pityingly. “Darling, I know
it will be hard. If you don’t feel able to face it, you mustn’t
force yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if he is ill and lonely?” Her eyes wandered up the
garden bank almost fearfully. She turned a pleading face
toward her husband. “Vittorio, help me! What shall I do?
Do you think seeing me again might do him harm if he is
not well?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Honesty conquering fear, he shook his head. “Why should
it? It may even be good for him. Come <i>coraggio</i>, Anne!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His noble simplicity shamed her. A lump in her throat,
she nodded dumbly. Vittorio signed to the delighted dragoman.
They swung about and put in at the small landing
place. Knees trembling beneath her, Anne disembarked, and
she and Vittorio strolled up the grassy bank towards the villa.</p>

<p class='c008'>The music, stilled for the last few minutes, smote the air
once more with a tragic, persistent monotony. The player
was evidently improvising upon some doleful, Arabic theme,
perhaps a song of the boatmen. Anne pressed against Vittorio.
“It makes my very soul shed tears,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had neared the house. Low, rectangular, surrounded
by palms and rosebushes, it rose directly in front of them.
Upon the awninged terrace, iron chair tip-tilted against the
pinkish walls, the violinist suddenly ceased playing. He laid
his instrument upon the table next to him and looked idly into
the distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although unspeakably altered, it was undoubtedly Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two great tears gliding down her cheeks, Anne signed to
Vittorio to wait for her. She mounted the shallow steps alone
and approached Alexis, touching him lightly where the slim
shoulders showed gaunt beneath the loose linen coat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As if galvanized by the sound of her voice, the motionless
figure sprang suddenly to life. The sunken eyes leaped to
Anne’s, widened, then remained fixed. She came a little
closer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is I, Anne. Don’t you know me, Alexis?” she murmured
very gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dilated eyes traveled over her face. He passed an
emaciated hand over his forehead, beneath dampened locks.
“Have I the delirium again?” His voice was hoarse, almost
toneless, not the boyish voice she remembered so well. More
altered, in fact, than the poor face which, at a distance, still
appeared youthful, although near to, it showed lined and haggard,
dry skin stretched taut over hectic cheek-bones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne’s heart yearned over him sorrowfully. She sat down
beside him, and took one of the feverish hands between her
cool palms. “No, no, don’t be frightened, dear. You are not
dreaming. It is really Anne in the flesh. We—that is to
say I, was passing by on the water. I heard your violin and
stopped to listen. From what my dragoman told me, I
guessed it must be you. So I came. Will you forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forgive you?” The altered voice was full of wonder.
He still looked at her as if he scarcely believed in her reality.
The great suffering eyes, like those of a stray dog who has
found a master, wrung her heart. “Forgive you?” he
repeated monotonously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. For disobeying you and coming to you after all
these years?” Her voice was tremulous. As he listened the
stiff figure suddenly relaxed, leaned forward with a choked,
comprehending cry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anne, Anne, it is really you! Thank God! I have
prayed that I might see you once more before I died. God
is merciful after all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He grasped her hands, at first timidly, then eagerly with
hungry insatiability. Ran feverish fingers up her arms to her
shoulders, attained her face, caressed it with the groping,
seeking gestures of a blind man. Then, with a smothered cry,
he fell back limply in his chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alexis, my poor boy!” The gaunt, dry hands in hers,
Anne pressed them to her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cracked lips parted over set teeth, he leaned back, gasping
a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forgive me,” he whispered. “I am still rather weak.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was frightened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t there something I can do for you? Some medicine
you can take?”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a feeble movement of the still-graceful hands, he
brushed the idea aside. “The sight of you—is all—I want
to cure me completely,” he articulated between difficult,
hissing breaths. “You are more beautiful than ever, Anne.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her smile was wistful. “Dear Alexis, I am getting old
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old?” He looked genuinely surprised. “I see no
difference,” he added with no attempt at compliment. “Oh, Anne,
the years, how long they have been in passing!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She choked back a sob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet you shouldn’t be too unkind to them, dear Alexis,
for they have brought you fame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A wan smile rode the gaunt face. “Fame? What is that?
A bubble which dissipates as you grasp it,” he snatched at the
air. “A flower in your buttonhole that smells sweet at first,
but becomes rank before nightfall. A nothing for which
you pay with your heart’s sweat.” He paused and the thin
fingers drummed rhythmically on the iron table. “But you
mustn’t think I am ungrateful, Anne. The work itself, I
love, but only for itself. It has kept me sane. That—and
the boy.” His face brightened. He turned eagerly towards
Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me about him,” she whispered. “He must be a big
boy by now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Almost eleven.” The hoarse voice was full of pride.
“He is in school in England—I don’t dare to keep him with
me now.” He pointed to his chest. “I miss him every minute,
Anne. He has always spent his vacations with me ever since
he started going away to school. Before that, we were
together constantly. When he was a baby the little beggar
would go to sleep for my violin, when his nurse could do
nothing with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne smiled through tears. “You must love each other
very much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we do. He went with me on all my long tours. We
have been inseparable ever since——” he choked.</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded. “Yes, Alexis, I know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her somberly. The pent-up tragedy of the
years passed by in his dilated pupils. “We will not speak of
that,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head. “No, Alexis, but it was ghastly for
me, too. I feel I must tell you that, at least. I was ill, not
myself, for months. I was on the point of writing you many
times but——” she stopped while the crimson spread to her
forehead. It seemed too brutal to tell him about Vittorio and
the children.</p>

<p class='c008'>He understood her hesitation and smiled bravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I did the right thing after all! Anne, dearest, don’t
be afraid to tell me the truth. Are you happy at last?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Words were beyond her for the moment. She nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sighed contentedly. “I am glad—so glad,” he breathed.
“Are you married and have you children?” he continued with
eager simplicity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vittorio and I have been married for almost ten years,”
she replied brokenly. “We have two little boys,” she added
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Longing swept the drawn features. “How I should love
to see them,” he sighed wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When you are better you must come to Florence and pay
us a long visit,” she replied, trying to speak brightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He spread his hands, in careless fatalism. He smiled oddly.
“When I am better? Yes, when I am better, I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And bring the boy,” she continued, sturdily ignoring his
implication. “What is his name?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A light dawned back of the misery in his eyes. “Jack.
Just a simple English name, as unlike his father’s as possible.
And oh, Anne, he is unlike me. He cannot play a single
musical instrument, although he has been surrounded by musicians
all his life. He has no temperament at all. And he
loves sports. He has won a lot of medals already. He isn’t
even very good in his studies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His naïve pleasure in the latter fact struck Anne as so
comical that she actually laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Funny Alexis!” she said tenderly. “You certainly make
an odd father. But tell me, what school is Jack in? You
must give me his address. Do you think he would like to
come to us for the holidays? That is——” she added hastily,
Alexis was sensitive over receiving favors—“if he has made
no other plans?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His face was almost radiant. “He is at Eton. He would
love to go to you, I know. If you really want him. I can’t
have him here——” the smile faded. “And I was worrying
about where to send him. But—are you sure your husband
wouldn’t mind?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vittorio? Never,” said Anne confidently. “He loves
children. And—and he admires you tremendously, Alexis.
There is no, no hard feeling in his heart for you. Vittorio is
a very noble man and he appreciates nobility in others!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis bowed his head upon his chest. “Thank you, my
Anne. May I call you that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, of course, Alexis,” she patted the hand near hers.
She hesitated a moment. “Vittorio is here with me now.
Would you like to see him, dear? Or would it be too much
for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis’ face paled. The dry lips quivered. There was a
pause before he replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to see him,” he said firmly. “I want to
thank him for—for making you so happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are sure?” she insisted, a little frightened at her
temerity in bringing the two men together. The two men
whose lives had crossed so fatally, and yet who had never, in
the course of events, actually met face to face. Yet, if she
were really to help Alexis during the next few weeks of their
stay, the meeting was inevitable. Her hesitation was palpable.
Alexis reassured her, with pathetic vehemence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I am sure. Please call him, Anne darling.
Can’t you see I’ve passed beyond all stage of jealousy? My
illness seems to have extinguished the evil fire forever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiled at him tenderly. “I’ll call him, then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked to the edge of the terrace and beckoned towards
the garden. “Vittorio!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The crystalline tones resounded purely. A tall figure rose
from a bench back of the palms and approached them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is my husband, Alexis.” Anne’s voice rang slightly
tremulous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis got to his feet rather feebly and the two men clasped
hands. Vittorio was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sorry you are not well,” he said gently, as they all
sat down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis smiled. “That is good of you, Marchese. And it
is doubly good of you to permit the Marchesa to see me. I—I
am very grateful.” The smiling lips quivered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vittorio was touched. The stooping figure, the prematurely
haggard young face filled him with pity. He made an effort
to speak casually.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you will let us both come to see you very often.
We shall be here for at least six weeks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t know what it will mean to me,” said Alexis
eagerly. “I’ve hardly seen a soul for months,” he caught
himself up sharply, “but I’m sure you must be thirsty. I’ll
order something to drink at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please don’t bother,” cried Anne.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a smiling shake of the head, he struck an iridescent
little gong on the table beside him. Very correct in semitropical
livery, an English servant appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What would you like?” said Alexis, turning to his guests.
“Some whisky and soda, Marchese? Or would you prefer
iced sherbet? Hopkins keeps some on hand for me all the
time, as I find it very soothing. Then there is always Turkish
coffee, for which we are famous, aren’t we, Hopkins?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.” The man bowed with the flicker of a pleased
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>They chose the sherbet. Little spiced cakes from the bazaar
were passed with it. The conversation became light and
unstrained. Since the old days, Alexis had mixed much with
the world. Had been a big figure and had progressed beyond
ill-ease. After they finished the sherbet, he looked longingly
at Anne, and asked if she would not like to try some Slovakian
dances with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked doubtful. “Do you think you ought to to-day,
Alexis? Haven’t we tired you sufficiently?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head gayly. “Oh, no, I haven’t felt so fit
for ages. Have I, Hopkins?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sherbet cups in his hands, Hopkins coughed discreetly. His
mild eyes met Anne’s full of respectful warning. She nodded
at him behind Alexis’ shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you’ve had enough excitement for this afternoon,”
she said firmly. “Suppose I come to-morrow for a little
while?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked radiant. “To-morrow, and every day while you
are here!” he said with the tyrannical air of a spoiled child.
“But you must play with me now, this minute. The music
only arrived yesterday and I haven’t tried it yet.” He looked
at once so wistful and so happy that Anne relented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, but only for a little while, mind!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They entered the house. Rather over-elaborate, the long
drawing room was furnished in the French Algerian style
with several large divans and an immense Bokhara rug that
covered the entire floor. In the corner stood a grand piano
brought by Alexis from Cairo. Anne seated herself before
it and gave Alexis the key. Hopkins brought up a chair and
placed it by the piano for Alexis. He dropped into it with a
sulky little air, and commenced to tune up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hopkins thinks it tires me to stand,” he apologized crossly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he broke into the dance, ancient fire unquenched,
technique magnificently perfected. Plying the keyboard
mechanically, Anne listened, shaken to the very marrow. For
a moment it seemed as if time had never existed and she was
back again in Long Island, young lover by her side, their
souls welded in an ecstasy of sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Alexis stopped suddenly. He reeled in his chair.
“I’m—a bit giddy,” he gasped. The violin dropped on to the
floor from inert fingers. Then came the cough, the racking
typhoon of a cough that shattered the frail body in its gust.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speechless with terror, Anne and Vittorio looked at each
other helplessly. Hopkins poured some medicine into a wine-glass
and held it ready. He shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He shouldn’t ’ave done it, ma’am. ’Is cough do be cruel
such times.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A stained handkerchief to his lips, Alexis lay back in his
chair. Anne’s eyes fixed themselves upon the blood with a
shudder of pity. The medicine administered, she took Hopkins
aside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me the worst,” she said below her breath. “Is—is
he dying?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tears gathered in the man’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, ma’am. ’Es very bad. The doctor says ’e can’t
last six months.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” Anne stifled a cry, “Have you been with him
long?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The puckered lips trembled. “Hit’ll be goin’ on seven
years, ma’am. H’im sure hi don’t know ’at’ll become of me
when ’es gone. Hi’ll feel kinder lost-like.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne looked at him gratefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hadn’t you better get the doctor now?” she whispered
above the lump in her throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head sadly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, ma’am. There h’ain’t nothin’ ’e could do for ’im.
Jest to lay down and be quiet like is what ’e needs, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne took the hint meekly. She went up to the two men,
and took hold of Vittorio’s arm where he stood leaning over
Alexis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must go now, Vittorio. Alexis needs rest. I’m afraid
we should never have come!” Her sorrowful eyes met
Alexis’ apologetic gaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t say that,” he pleaded weakly. “I have an attack
like this very often now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out her hand and he grasped it with feeble fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It has been heaven to see you again,” he whispered. “Now
I can die happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne knelt down by the chair. From her aching eyes
brimmed scalding tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are going to get well, dear,” she murmured, “we are
going to make him, aren’t we, Vittorio?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the end was not yet. Several weeks were to pass first.
Meanwhile, Anne went to the villa every day. Once or
twice, when Alexis felt stronger, they played a little. But
he tired almost immediately. After a while they gave it up
tragically, tacitly. She read to him instead. And they talked
a little. But day by day he grew perceptibly weaker, and the
coughing spells racked him with greater ferocity.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day a letter came from Jack at Eton, accepting with
glee Anne’s invitation for the holidays. And Alexis, realizing
that the end was near, listened with joy as Anne read it to
him, and added of her own accord that she and Vittorio
wanted to look after the boy in the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In that way,” she added almost timidly, “I can be a mother
to him after all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexis made no reply. He merely raised emaciated hands
to his face, and Anne saw that he wept.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>That afternoon the sunset was unusually resplendent.
Purple and gold, it spread to the horizon where rolling, amber
sands merged into saffron skies. Anne’s boat, its henna sail
lurid against heaven, floated upon a sheet of solid gold. Solid
gold, Anne’s gleaming hair as, hatless, she crouched weeping
in the stern beside Vittorio. While purple clouds faded into
black and black and gold fused into lacquer.</p>

<p class='c008'>That afternoon the sunset was unusually resplendent, but
Anne wept because Alexis was no longer there to see.</p>
